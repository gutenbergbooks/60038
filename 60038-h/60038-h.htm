<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Great institutions are the shadows that
great men cast across the centuries. A
great law, a great liberty, a great art or tool
or reform represents a great soul, organized,
and made unconsciously immortal for all time.
Explorers trace the Nile or Amazon back to
the lake in which the river takes its rise. Historians
trace institutions back to some hero
from whose mind and heart the life-giving
movement pours forth. When the scholar
travels back to the far-off beginnings of jurisprudence,
he comes to some Moses, toiling in
Thebes, to some Solon in Athens, to some Justinian
in Rome. Not otherwise the renaissance
of painting, sculpture, and architecture
begins with some Giotto, some Michael Angelo,
some Christopher Wren. Scholars often speak
of history as narratory or philosophical, but
in the last analysis, history is biographical.
These studies were prepared for the students
of Plymouth Institute in the belief that biography
is life's wisest teacher, and that the
lives of great men are the most inspiring books
to be found in our libraries.</p>

<h2>I<br />
DANTE<br />
(1265&ndash;1321)</h2>
<h3><i>And the Dawn After the Dark Ages</i></h3>

<p>All scholars are agreed as to the classes
of men who build the State. There are
the soldiers who keep the State in liberty, the
physicians who keep the State in health, the
teachers who sow the land with wisdom and
knowledge, the farmers and merchants who
feed and clothe the people, the prophets who
keep the visions burning, and the poets who
inspire and fertilize the soul of the race. But
in every age and clime, the poet has been the
real builder of his city and country. The
only kind of work that lives forever is the
work of the poet. Parthenons and cathedrals
crumble, tools rust, bridges decay, bronzes
melt, but the truth, put in artistic work, survives
war, flood, fire, and the tooth of time
itself. "The poet's power," said George
William Curtis, "is not dramatic, obvious,
imposing, immediate, like that of the statesman,
the warrior and the inventor. But it is
as deep and as strong and abiding. The
soldier fights for his native land, but the poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
makes it worth fighting for. The statesman
enlarges liberty, but the poet fosters that love
in the heart of the citizen. The inventor
multiplies the conveniences of life, but the
poet makes the life itself worth living. We
cannot find out the secret of his power. Until
we know why the rose is sweet, or the dewdrop
pure, or the rainbow beautiful, we cannot
know why the poet is the best benefactor
of humanity. But we know that the poet is
the harmonizer, strengthener and consoler,
and that the inexpressible mystery of Divine
Love and purpose has been best breathed in
parable and poem."</p>

<p>By common consent the three great poets
of the world are Homer, Dante and Shakespeare;
and of the three, the two supreme
names are Dante and Shakespeare. After six
centuries, what Hallam said nearly a hundred
years ago still holds true: "Dante's orbit is
his own, and the track of his wheels can never
be confounded with that of any rival."
Dante was the greatest man of his country, he
wrote the greatest book of his era, he started
the greatest intellectual movement of any age
or time. The influence of his thinking upon
the people of Italy, the Italy of his own day
and of succeeding generations, is one of the
marvels of history. He was the interpreter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
of his age to itself; but he was also the interpreter
of man to all ages. Some names there
are whose light shines brightly for a brief
time, after the fashion of the falling stars,
but Dante's emblem is the sun, whose going
forth is unto the ends of the earth, and whose
shining brings universal summer.</p>

<p>Dante has been well-called the "Morning
Star of the Renaissance." He was born at
the end of, perhaps, the darkest period in history,&mdash;the
five black centuries succeeding the
fall of Rome; he lived to see the first fruits of
his own sowing&mdash;that wonderful rebirth of art
and culture which was to culminate, two hundred
years later, in the canvases of Raphael
and the sculptures of Michael Angelo. It has
been beautifully said that before singing his
song Dante had to invent his harp. No graceful
phrase ever had a sounder kernel of truth.
Great poets are more than great artists in
language; they create languages, and Dante,
like his two great compeers, Homer and
Shakespeare, moulded and shaped the tongue
for future generations. He began his career
at a moment when the Latin tongue was dying
and the Italian language was still waiting to
be born. He took the vulgar speech of his
own day and gave it colour and richness, form
and substance, eternal dignity and beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
What Homer did for the Greek language, what
King Alfred's Bible did for English literature,
that, and more, did Dante for the Italian
tongue. The influence of his thinking upon
the people of Italy is indicated by the fact
that <i>The Divine Comedy</i> was printed three
times in the one year of 1472, nine times before
the fifteenth century ended, and, to-day,
there are literally thousands of volumes in the
libraries of the world upon Dante and his
poems. With loving extravagance d'Annunzio
said at the great celebration held last year in
Italy: "Single-handed Dante created Italy,
as Michael Angelo by sheer force of genius
created his <i>Moses</i>, and made it the supreme
marble in history."</p>

<p>No one has ever been able to define genius,
though many scholars have told us what
genius is not. Many men in the English lecture
halls and universities had talent, but that
stablekeeper's son, John Keats, had genius.
More than one of the four hundred members of
the House of Lords during Charles the
Second's reign had talent, but a poor tinker,
John Bunyan, had genius, that blazed like the
sun. There were multitudes of men living in
the Thirteen Colonies, and many of them rich,
but that poor boy flying a kite, Benjamin
Franklin, had the divine gift. Not otherwise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
many men living in Florence at the end of
the thirteenth century had talent, but Dante
Alighieri had the gift, and he towered above
his fellows as Monte Rosa towers above the
burning plains of Italy. Strictly speaking,
Dante's gift was not that of the poet alone.
He was a moralist as well as a poet&mdash;above all
others, the singer of man's soul. He believed
himself to be ordained of God to explain the
moral order of the universe, man's share in
that order, his duty and his destiny. Blind
Homer gave us the immortal <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>,
but Homer was a poet, not a teacher,
and if there are lessons in the story of Achilles
and Ulysses we have to learn those lessons for
ourselves. Shakespeare, the organ-voice of
England, gave us <i>Lear</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Othello</i>
and <i>Macbeth</i>, but Shakespeare was a poet, not
a teacher, and Macbeth's sin, written though
it is in letters of fire, is nevertheless accompanied
by no comments of the author. Not
so with the immortal <i>Comedy</i> of Dante. For
Dante was a teacher first, and a poet afterward.
Without the brilliancy of intellect or
the compass of achievements that were Shakespeare's,
without the directness or the simplicity
of Homer, he was more serious than
either. He had the passion of a reformer,
the fiery courage of a prophet. He poured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
very heart's blood into his pages. Hating
oppression, he was like one specially raised up
to point the path to peace, and to vindicate
the ways of God to man.</p>

<p>The great thinker was born in Florence in
the year 1265. His era was the era of the
Dark Ages; his century one of the submerged
centuries. For five hundred years black darkness
had lain upon the world. It was an era
of war, when barons were constantly at strife.
Feudalism was entrenched behind stone walls,
the landowners were masters, and the serfs
were slaves. Every road was infested with
bandits. There was no shipping upon the
Mediterranean. The mariner's compass had
not yet been invented. Commerce was scant
and factories almost unknown. Men lived,
for the most part, on coarse bread and vegetables,
without luxuries, and without what we
call the simplest necessities. The common
people were huddled in miserable villages, behind
stone walls, with unpaved streets and
windowless houses, in which ignorance, filth,
squalor, and bestiality prevailed. Peasants
wore the same leather garments for a lifetime.
The dead were buried under the churches.
Prisoners rotted in dungeons under the banqueting
hall of the castle. Two hundred
years were to pass before Columbus set foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
upon the deck of the <i>Santa Maria</i>. Two
hundred and fifty years were to pass before
Michael Angelo could lift the dome above St.
Peter's. But if the peasant was ignorant, and
the poor man wretched, the nobleman and
courtier was the child of luxury and gilded
vice. It was an age of contrasts so violent as
to be all but incredible to the modern reader.
There were no books, for the art of printing
was still to be invented, yet in an age of parchment
manuscripts young noblemen were
taught to speak in verse and to write in
rhymed pentameters. There was no science
of geography and the world was believed to be
a flat board with a fence around it. Yet in this
era, when few men could spell and fewer read,
the very monks in the monasteries were writing
theses on problems so abstract as to weary
the modern scholar. For five hundred years
the world had looked to the Church, but the
Church had descended to the perpetration of
crimes so terrible, that their mere chronicle
sickens the heart and chills the blood.</p>

<p>Into this world of paradox and contradiction&mdash;a
world of gloom, shot through with
fitful gleams of superstition&mdash;was born Dante,
the poet of love and hope and divine regeneration.
We know little of Dante's parentage, as
we know all too little of his life, but this much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
we do know&mdash;the family was the noble family
of the Alighieri, followers and supporters of
the party then in power in Florence. Dante
was educated by his mother, and by his mother's
relative, the scholar-poet Brunetto Latini.
Like John Stuart Mill he was a mental
prodigy from infancy. Like Milton he was
trained in the strictest academical education
which the age afforded. Like Bacon he was
a universal scholar before he passed out of his
teens. Like Pope he thought and wrote in
verse before he could write in prose. Among
his friends and intimates were the poets Guido
Cavalcanti and Cino da Pistoria, Dino Frescobaldi
and Lapo Guianni, the musician Casella
and the artist Giotto. With such companions
and under such guidance, Dante
mastered all the sciences of the day at a time
when it was not impossible to know all that
could be known.</p>

<p>But dreamer and student though he was, he
early insisted upon sharing the burdens of the
State. On two occasions he bore arms for his
country. While still in his twenties he was
offered the post of ambassador to Rome; before
he was thirty he had represented his
native city at foreign courts, and from his
thirtieth to his thirty-fifth year his voice was
heard with growing frequency in municipal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
affairs. In the summer of the year 1300,
when he was thirty-five years of age, he was
chosen as one of the Priors, or magistrates, of
Florence.</p>

<p>The opening year of the new century&mdash;the
year in which Giotto was meditating his immortal
<i>Duomo</i>, with its famous tower&mdash;was
ushered in by a civic revolution in Florence.
Dante, with other innocent citizens, was banished
and condemned to death by burning. A
statesman, he saw his party defeated and
driven from the land; a man of property, he
lost his whole fortune; one of the proudest of
men, he was forced to humble himself and live
on foreign alms. Inspired by the noblest intentions,
the world gave him no thanks, but
drove him forth like a wild beast, branded
his name with foul crimes and condemned him
to wander over the hills of Italy till death at
last gave him release. He never saw Florence
again. For years he knew poverty, neglect
and hatred. Sick with the noise of political
dissension, he strained his eyes toward the
hills for the appearance of a universal monarch;
but the vision was never realized. We
know but little of his wanderings. Many
cities and castles have claimed the honour of
giving him shelter; we know only that in old
age he was compelled to "climb the stranger's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
toilsome stairs, and eat the bitter bread of
others."</p>

<p>Such, briefly sketched, is the life-history of
this man who has been called "the voice of
ten silent centuries." In an era of luxury he
had lived simply and frugally; in an era of
debate and publicity, he had preferred seclusion;
drawn at last into public life by his own
sense of duty, he had been driven forth into
exile, to die alone in a foreign city. It is the
greatness of Dante that, in spite of defeat and
disappointment, in spite of every form of
hardship, in the face of every conceivable
form of adversity, he went on with his work
and completed his masterpiece, the greatest
achievement in the whole history of Italian
literature. Out of his own heart-break he
distilled hope and encouragement for others
and from the broken harmonies of his own
life he created a world-symphony.</p>

<p>The best-loved books in our libraries are
books of heroism, books of eloquence, books of
success, and books of love. It is a matter of
misfortune that no history of human love has
ever been written. Scholars have set forth
the history of wars, the history of engines and
ships, the history of laws and reforms, but no
library holds a history of the greatest gift of
man, the gift of love. That is the one creative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
gift that belongs to his soul. Beyond all
other writers, the author of the <i>Divine
Comedy</i> is the poet of love. Love was the
inspiration of his youth, the beacon of his
middle life and the transfiguring glory of his
old age. All his poems are monuments to the
abiding and ennobling power of a pure passion.
His love for Beatrice has fascinated
the generations, and remains to-day one of the
few immortal love stories of the world, as
moving as the romance of Abelard and
H&eacute;loise, and infinitely more exalting. No
understanding of his poems is possible without
a knowledge of that love and its tremendous
influence upon his life and work.</p>

<p>Beatrice Portinari, the object of Dante's
devotion, was the daughter of a merchant, living
in a street not far from his father's house.
Dante saw her but a few times, and she died
when he was twenty-seven, but from the
moment when, on that bright spring morning,
he first viewed her lovely face, his whole heart
and mind were kindled. "She appeared to
me," he writes, "at a festival, dressed in that
most noble and honourable colour, scarlet&mdash;girden
and ornamented in a manner suitable
to her age, and from that moment love ruled
my soul. After many days had passed, it
happened that passing through the streets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
she turned her eyes to the spot where I stood,
and with ineffable courtesy, she greeted me,
and this had such an effect on me that it
seemed I had reached the furthest limit of
blessedness." He describes but three other
meetings. While he was absent from the city&mdash;probably
during one of the two campaigns
in which he fought&mdash;her father gave her in
marriage to another man. She was only
twenty-four when she died.</p>

<p>No one will ever know whether Beatrice was
indeed the loveliest girl in Italy; whether she
really was the daughter of intellect, or
whether the greatness was in Dante, who projected
the image of beauty, created by his
imagination and superimposed upon Beatrice.
We all know that it is within the power of the
sun in the late afternoon to cast the brilliant
hues of gold and purple upon the vine and
transform slender tendrils into purest gold.
Dante had a powerful intellect, the finest
imagination of any known artist, vast moral
endowments&mdash;gifts, however, that in themselves
are impotent. The sailing vessel, no
matter how large the sails, is helpless until
the winds fill the canvas, and hurl the cargo
toward some far-off port. Just as Abelard
waited for the coming of H&eacute;loise; just as
Robert Browning's soul was never properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
enkindled before the coming of Elizabeth
Barrett, so the intellect of Dante waited for
Beatrice. The quality and quantity of flame
in the fireplace is not determined by the size
of the match that kindles the fire, but by the
quality of fuel that waits for the spark. The
strength and power of Dante's attachment was
in the vast endowments of his soul, and not
in Beatrice. It may well be that thirty years
later, Dante, who realized that he was the
strongest man then living in the world and
who was at once a scholar, a statesman and a
soldier, during the solitude of his exile in a
distant city turned his mind backward and
broke the alabaster box of genius upon the
head of a commonplace girl, just as Raphael
lent the beauty of St. Cecilia to the face and
figure of a flower-woman, a girl whose face
and figure furnished the outlines for his drawing,
but held no part of the divine, ineffable
and dazzling loveliness of an angel.</p>

<p>Whatever the truth&mdash;and there is little
chance that we shall ever know the truth&mdash;this
much is certain: Dante's earliest long
poem, the famous "<i>Vita Nuova</i>" (New Life)
celebrates his love for Beatrice, and is nothing
more than a journal of the heart, a secret
diary of his emotions. The <i>Vita Nuova</i> is as
far removed from the modern sentimental love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
tale as June is removed from some almanac
prepared a year in advance of the weather
changes predicted. It records Dante's first
glimpse of Beatrice, the adoration she
awakened in him, and the fervour of devotion
to which she lifted him; it describes his premonition
of her death, and it ends with his
resolve to devote his remaining years to her
memory. The last chapter of the book looks
forward to the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. About a year
after Beatrice's death, he writes: "It was
given me to behold a wonderful vision, wherein
I saw things which determined me to say
nothing further of this blessed one unto such
time as I could discourse more worthily concerning
her. And to this end I labour all I
can, as she in truth knoweth. Therefore if it
be His pleasure through whom is the life of
all things that my life continue with me a few
years, it is my hope that I shall yet write concerning
her what hath not before been written
of any woman." Completed years later, the
immortal <i>Comedy</i> exists to-day as the most
wonderful tribute to a woman ever penned
by any poet.</p>

<p>In a mood of lofty pride, Dante placed himself
among the six great poets of all time.
To-day, all scholars applaud the accuracy and
humility of his judgment. Every strong man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
knows what he can do. He is conscious of his
own vast reserves. So often has he measured
himself with his fellow-men that he realizes the
number, the magnitude and relative strength
of his divine endowments. All men of the
first order of genius have realized the endowment
they have received from God and their
fathers. And the <i>Divine Comedy</i> justifies
Dante's pride in his own powers. It cannot
be classified with a phrase nor dismissed with
a label. It is not a poem, like one of Tennyson's
<i>Idylls of the King</i>; it is rather an encyclopedia
upon Italy. It is at one and the same moment
an autobiography, a series of personal reminiscences,
a philosophy, an oration and the
spiritual pilgrimage of a thirteenth century
<i>Childe Harold</i>, with here and there a lyric
poem. The motive which inspired Dante
was his sense of the wretchedness of man in
this mortal life. The only means of rescue
from this wretchedness he conceived to be the
exercise of reason, enlightened by God. To
convince man of this truth, to bring home to
him the conviction of the eternal consequences
of his conduct in this world, to show him the
path of salvation, was Dante's aim. To lend
force and beauty to such a design he conceived
the poem as an allegory, and made himself
to be its protagonist. He depicts a vision, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
which the poet is conducted first by Virgil, as
the representative of human reason, through
Hell and Purgatory, and then by Beatrice,
as the representative of divine revelation,
through Paradise to the Heaven, where at last
he beholds the triune God.</p>

<p>The action of the <i>Divine Comedy</i> opens in
the early morning of the Thursday before
Easter in the year 1300. Dante dreams that he
had "reached the half-way point in his path of
life, at the entrance of an obscure forest."
He would advance, but three horrible beasts
bar the way, a wolf, a lion and a leopard,
symbolical of the temptations of the world&mdash;cupidity,
the pride of life and the lusts of the
flesh. Then the shade of Virgil appears, representing
the intellect and conscience, glorified&mdash;to
serve as his guide in the long wanderings
through the Inferno. Virgil tells him he
can accompany him only through Hell and
Purgatory, but that Beatrice shall conduct
him through those happy spheres, the portals
of which a pagan may not enter. So begins
that wondrous journey through the regions
of the damned, over the entrance of which is
written the awful words: "All hope abandon
ye who enter here." The world through
which the two poets journey is peopled, not
with characters of heroic story, but with men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and women known personally or by repute to
Dante. Popes, kings, emperors, poets and
warriors, Florentine citizens of all degrees are
there, "some doomed to hopeless punishment,
others expiating their offenses in milder torments
and looking forward to deliverance in
due time." Hell is conceived as a vast conical
hollow, reaching to the center of the earth. It
has three great divisions, corresponding to
Aristotle's three classes of vice, incontinence,
brutishness and malice. The sinners, by
malice, are divided from the last by a yet more
formidable barrier. They lie at the bottom
of a pit, with vertical sides, and accessible
only by supernatural means; a monster named
Geryon bears the poets down on his back. At
the very bottom of the pit is Lucifer, immovably
fixed in ice. And climbing down his
limbs, the travellers reach the center of the
earth, whence a cranny conducts them back
to the surface, which they reach as Easter Day
is dawning.</p>

<p>Purgatory is conceived as a mountain, rising
solitary from the ocean on that side of the
earth that is opposite to ours. It is divided
into terraces and its top is the terrestrial Paradise,
the first abode of man. The seven terraces
correspond to the seven deadly sins,
which encircle the mountain and are reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
by a series of steep climbs, compared by Dante
to the path from Florence to Samminiato.
The penalties are not degrading, but rather
tests of patience or endurance; and in several
cases Dante has to bear a share in them as he
passes. At one point, the poet hesitates when
he comes to a path filled with a sheet of flame;
but Virgil speaks: "Between Beatrice and
thee there is but that wall." Dante at once
plunges into the heart of the flames. On the
summit of the mountain is the Earthly Paradise,
"a scene of unsurpassed magnificence,"
where Beatrice, representing divine knowledge,
divine love and purity, is waiting to
lead the wanderer through the nine spheres of
the old Ptolemaic system to the very throne
of God.</p>

<p>Such is the general scheme of the poem, in
which Dante's conception of the universe is
depicted in scenes of intense vividness and
dramatic force. It embraces the whole field
of human experience. Its aim is "not to delight,
but to reprove, to rebuke, to exhort, to
form men's characters" by teaching them
what courses of life will meet reward, what
with penalty hereafter; to "put into verse,"
as the poet says, "things difficult to think."
The title given it is often misunderstood. The
men of the Middle Ages gave the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"Tragedy" to every poem that ended sadly,
and the name "Comedy" to every tale that
ended happily. There are no traces of wit
and humour in this book with its descriptions
of the cleansing pains of Purgatory and the
highest reaches of Paradise. Men who have
little imagination seem quite unable to transport
themselves back into the life and thought
of the thirteenth century. Even Voltaire
calls Dante a savage, and Goethe, who blundered
often in his judgments of men and
books, and often had to reverse himself, thought
Dante's work "dull and unreadable." But
that reader who supposes that Dante is
giving a literal description of the physical torments
of hell, or imagines that Michael Angelo,
in his <i>Last Judgment</i>, was portraying his
own literal belief, will find nothing inspiring
in this wonderful book.</p>

<p>During the last six centuries the thinking of
the world has changed. Physical pain has
assumed new importance. No man living to-day
has ever witnessed a brother man sentenced
by a court to be burned alive, or later
on, has been tried himself, and upon a false
charge sentenced to death by flame. We stand
aghast at Dante's miseries and monsters, furies
and gorgons, snakes and fires, lakes of pitch
and pools of blood, a physical hell of utter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
unspeakable dreariness and despair. But
Dante's was an era of outbreaking and almost
universal physical cruelty; sinners and criminals
could not be reached by argument, for
they could not think; there was but one way to
approach animal man, and that was from the
animal side. Through fear, Dante endeavoured
to scourge men back from the horrors of iniquity.
He appealed to material men through
the imagery of material flames, and slowly by
this scourge, tried to drive them back toward
obedience, sympathy and love for the poor and
the weak. For their allurement also he
showed them a golden city in the far-off blue,
with the flowers blooming in the fields of
Paradise. He used his unrivalled genius to
make vice and sin revolting and infinitely repulsive,
just as he tried to make truth, kindness
and justice alluring.</p>

<p>This volume, therefore, represents "the life
history of a human soul redeemed from sin
and error, from lust and wrath and mammon,
and restored to the right path by the reason
and the grace which enable him to see things
as they are." Dante's conception is that
"penalty is the same thing as sin, only it is
sin taken at a later period of its history and a
little lower down the stream." It is in life,
here and now, that men's hands are fouled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
with the pits of greed; their tongues tipped
with envenomed hate; their hearts steeped in
crimson ooze. It is here and now that
materialists "load themselves down with sacks
of yellow clay," that misers plunge into "the
boiling pitch of avarice." The genius of the
<i>Inferno</i> is that sins are seeds, big with the
harvest of their own penalty.</p>

<p>Our age makes little of the <i>Purgatory</i> itself&mdash;this
realm which Dante describes as the
place where the human soul is cleansed and
made worthy to ascend to heaven. It is described
as a kind of vestibule of Paradise,
where the soul fronts the results of wrong-doing,
through the debt of penalty and the
evil inclination of the will, and the instincts
that have been perverted. The sins of which
men are cleansed are the sins against love and
pride, envy and anger; the sins of the body,
avarice and gluttony and passion. The angels
that cleanse are the angels of forgiveness and
peace. On that island of cleansing Virgil and
Dante land, and place their hands upon the
ground and bathe in dew their tear-stained
cheeks. But climbing up the steep way of
penitence is like climbing up a craggy mountainside,
toiling on hands and knees, with tire
that almost brings despair; and yet the higher
Dante climbs the easier the task. Just as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the <i>Inferno</i>, Dante placed certain well-known
figures&mdash;Judas Iscariot, who for avarice betrayed
his Lord, and Alberigo who with horrible
treachery murdered his own guests at a
banquet, and that "youth who made the Great
Refusal"; so in the <i>Purgatory</i> he shows us
many men known to history who have stumbled
here and there and are breast-buried in
the rubbish of the world, to whom comes some
angel bringing release, and whispering
"Loose him, and let him go."</p>

<p>When he approaches the confines of Paradise
and sees from afar the glorified form of
Beatrice, Dante asks that God may become to
his soul like a refiner's fire and cleanse away
any stain or dross of sin. Gladly he enters
that healing flame, guided by a sweet voice,
which sang, "Come, ye blessed of my Father;"
but, says Dante, "When I was within I would
have flung myself into molten glass to cool
myself, so immeasurable was the burning
there." Then, broken down with utter remorse,
he falls in a swoon; but he is plunged
in the waters of forgetfulness and refreshed,
like young plants; re-clad as if by the angel of
spring, he issues from the wave, pure and
true, ready to mount to the stars beyond.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, this book, the <i>Inferno</i>, is
the most widely read. The <i>Purgatory</i> is less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
frequently opened, while men value least of
all the <i>Paradise</i> of Dante. Doubtless the
reason is that experience has brought familiarity
with sin, so that all men understand its
penalties, and at the selfsame time know
something of penitence and of pardon, while
the nature of that realm of perfect happiness,
righteousness and peace is beyond human experience.
But if any man was ever purified
by suffering and earned the right to trust his
visions and surrender himself to the pictures
that noble imagination painted, that man was
Dante. On the side of culture the measure of
education of any man is his knowledge of
Shakespeare. On the side of imagination and
of pure and tender goodness, a man is a man
just in proportion as he knows his Dante.
James Russell Lowell's supreme essay was his
essay on Dante, and he tells us that the great
Italian "wrote with his heart's blood, like an
inspired prophet of old." 'Midst all his poverty,
exile and grief, he rose triumphant over
sorrow and neglect. He never lost his confidence
in the ultimate victory of right and
truth. Hating oppression, he struggled as a
prophet of liberty. Offered an invitation to
return to his native city, on the condition that
he would humiliate himself by confessing that
he had done a wrong, he accepted an exile's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
death rather than be faithless to his great convictions.
Climbing the stairs of other men's
houses, he salted his bread with his own tears.</p>

<p>An old man at fifty-six, his last days were
spent in Ravenna, in the house of a noble
duke, who recognized in Dante the greatest
man of his time. Long afterward, Byron
sought out the house where Dante died, and
falling upon his knees, beat upon his breast
and wept, at the recollection of the sorrows
that overwhelmed the master of them all.
Just as Bunyan was rewarded for the second
book in English literature by twelve years in
Bedford Jail, so Dante, as a reward for writing
the greatest book in Italian literature, was
exiled from his home and city, pursued by
spies, hunted over the hills with hounds, made
to conceal himself in dens and caves of the
earth, and brought to an untimely death.
Dying, Dante might have used the words
which, later, fell from the lips of Bacon, "I
leave my name and fame to foreign lands, and
to my own country when long time has
passed." Let us believe that after having lived
for fifty-six years in at once an <i>Inferno</i> and a
<i>Purgatory</i>, at last Dante, the prisoner, was redeemed
out of his dungeon, the exile out of his
loneliness, the fugitive out of his rags and
crusts, and the cave wherein he was hiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
from his pursuers; that the man who for years
held heart-break at bay at last was brought in
out of the night, the fire-mist and the hail,
into the imperial palaces of God, where one
word of welcome repaid him ten thousand
times for the bitter, grievous years, and where
one word of love leaped forth from the ineffable
light&mdash;and in a moment, his every
wound was healed!</p>

<h2>II<br />
SAVONAROLA<br />
(1452&ndash;1498)</h2>
<h3><i>And the Renaissance of Conscience</i></h3>

<p>When the first warm days of May come
to a land chilled through with the
frosts of winter, all pastures and meadows, all
vineyards and orchards, even the desert and
the mountain rift awake to a new bloom and
beauty. The revival of learning which culminated
in that golden age known as the Renaissance
was ushered in by the poet Dante, with
his love for Beatrice and his immortal poem
called the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. Dante has been
likened unto that angel who descended
from Heaven and, standing with one foot on
the sea and one on the land, lifted the trumpet
to his lips, and wakened the whole world.
To Dante belongs the double glory "of immortalizing
in verse the centuries behind him,
while he inaugurated a new age and created
a new language." But if Dante's face was
turned upward and backward, his work was
taken up by the great humanist, Petrarch,
whose face was toward the future. Soon the
whole land was awake, and while other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
countries were held in the grip of ice and
winter, full summer burst upon Italy.</p>

<p>Scholars have interpreted the Renaissance
from many different angles. Students of
literature identify it with the discovery and
reproduction of the manuscripts of the Greek
and Latin authors. Artists associate it with
Giotto's paintings and tower, with Michael
Angelo's <i>Moses and Last Judgment</i>, and with
the names of Alberti and Leonardo. Scientists
point toward the discoveries of Copernicus
and Columbus, just as jurists think of the rise
of popular freedom and the overthrow of
tyranny. Practical men associate the new era
with the art of printing and the manufacture
of paper and gunpowder, with the use of the
compass by mariners, and the telescope by
astronomers. But none of these interpretations
fully suffice to explain the new era, with
its new energy of the intellect and its outburst
of unrivalled genius.</p>

<p>The mental and emotional condition of
Europe at the beginning of the fifteenth
century may be likened to the vague longings
in the heart of that child, who, legend hath it,
was carried away from his father's castle by
a band of gipsies. The gipsies carried the boy
to Spain, and there they taught him to ride
and hunt and steal after the gipsy fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
But he had the blood of his ancestors within
him, and there was something burning and
throbbing within. Sometimes in his dreams
he saw a beautiful face leaning over him, and
heard the bosom pressure words of his mother,
who could not be forgotten. Not otherwise
was it with society at the beginning of the
fifteenth century. For centuries the books,
the arts, the tools, once so familiar to
Virgil and Horace, to M&aelig;cenas and C&aelig;sar
Augustus had lain neglected on the shores of
that Dead Sea called the Dark Ages. Vague
and uneasy memories haunted Europe. Imagination
increased the value of the lost
treasure. Looking backward through an
atmosphere roseate through fancy, Helen's
face took on new loveliness. Achilles became
the ideal knight, Ulysses a divine hero, and
Penelope the sum of all the gifts distributed
among ideal women.</p>

<p>But in the middle of the fifteenth century
occurred the fall of Constantinople, that
Saragossa sea into which had been drawn the
literary treasures of the preceding centuries.
Constantinople had become a treasure-house in
which were assembled the manuscripts that
had been carried away by the citizens of
Rome fleeing from the Huns. As the centuries
came and went, merchants, bankers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
rich men from far-off provinces had taken
their jewels, carved furniture, ivories, paintings,
bronzes, marbles, rugs, silks, laces, and
housed their treasure in palaces, looking out
upon the Bosphorus. So that in 1452, when
the advancing Saracens approached the city,
the scholars and rich men of Constantinople
fled to their boats, and spreading canvas
sailed into the western sun. Months passed
before these fugitives dropped anchor at the
mouth of the Po. One morning, an old man,
wrapped in a cloak stained with the salt seawater,
stepped from a little boat to the wharf
of Florence. Being poor and also hungry he
made his way to a bread-shop. Having no
money, he drew from beneath his cloak a
parchment. When the bread-shop was filled
with listeners he began to read the story of
Helen's beauty and Achilles' courage; the
story of Ulysses' wanderings and Penelope's
fidelity; the tale of blind &OElig;dipus, and of his
daughter's loving care. He recited the oration
of Pericles after the plague in Athens,
and told the story of the wanderings of
&AElig;neas. With ever-increasing excitement the
men of Florence listened. At last, waking
from the spell, they lifted the stranger upon
their shoulders and carried him to the palace
of a merchant prince, and bade him tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
story, and soon the merchant's house was
crowded with young men preparing pages of
vellum and sheets of leather, while writers
copied the poems and the dramas of the old
manuscript, and artists turned the vellum
pages into illuminated missals. The spark
became a flame. Learning became a glorious
contagion. The fires spread from village to
village, and city to city. The dawn of the
modern world had come.</p>

<p>In the city of Florence, circumstances and
climate were singularly favourable to the new
movement. Florence was the city of flowers;
it lay upon the banks of the Arno, set amidst
orange groves, and its palaces, art galleries,
and churches, when the vineyards were in full
bloom, looked like a string of pearls lying in
a cup of emeralds. All that Athens had been
to the age of Pericles, Florence was to be to the
era of Savonarola. Neither time nor events
have availed to lessen the hold of Florence
upon the great men of earth. Because of her
rich associations with genius and beauty, the
greatest souls of the earth have often turned
feet toward Florence, as the birds of paradise
leave the desert to seek out the oasis with its
fountain and flowers. Florence was the city
of Dante with his <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the city of
Giotto, with his tower, of Gioberti, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
gates of wrought iron that are so beautiful
that Michael Angelo said they were worthy to
be the gates of Paradise. To Florence in
after years went Robert Browning, to write
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>, and Elizabeth Barrett,
with the finest love sonnets in literature.
To Florence centuries later went George Eliot,
to write her <i>Romola</i>, and in Florence,
Keats and Shelley dreamed their dreams of
song and verse. To Florence came Cavour,
the statesman, and Mazzini, the reformer,
Garibaldi, the soldier, to build the new Italy.
Many the scholar and patriot who has said
with Robert Browning, "Italy is a word
graven on my heart." And it was to Florence
that there came in the year 1490 Savonarola,
the greatest moral force the city ever
knew.</p>

<p>Savonarola was a man of almost universal
genius. He was an orator, and the fire of his
eloquence still burns in the sermons he has
left the world. He was a reformer, and descended
upon the sins of his age like a flame
of fire, shaking Italy like the stroke of an
earthquake. He was a prophet, and he
dreamed dreams of a new Italy and of a
golden age in morals. He was a statesman
and he was created a preacher, and he fulfilled
the dreams of a divine Orpheus, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
drew all things to him by the mystery and
magic of his speech. He was a martyr, and
wore, not the red hat of the cardinal, but the
fire that belonged to the chariot of flame, in
which his soul rode up to Heaven to meet his
God. Like all men of the first order of genius
he was great on many sides. It was his glory
that he awakened the moral sense and brought
the life of God into the soul of man. Savonarola
was like the Matterhorn or the Breithorn
that lift their peaks so high that they
look out upon the Rhine of the north and the
Po of the south, upon the vineyards of France
and the valleys of Austria.</p>

<p>In the very year that Constantinople fell,
and the scholars fled, carrying their manuscripts&mdash;as
sparks fly from the hammer falling
upon an anvil&mdash;Savonarola entered into being
in the beautiful little city of Ferrara. His
grandfather was a physician, a teacher of the
youth of his town, and a member of the
council. He had achieved some honour as a
scholar, and won much gold and favour as a
skillful surgeon. To his father's house came
a few leading men of the villages round about
to read the pages of Dante and to talk about
the manuscripts that had thrown all Italy into
a fever of excitement. The boy had a hungry
mind, and rose early and sat up late to read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
the copies of the few books that his father had
in the little library. His native town was the
capital of the little state, and the Duke of Este
was his father's friend. When the boy was
six years of age, Pope Pius II passed through
Ferrara on his way to a celebration in Venice,
and in preparation for his coming a crimson
canopy was stretched above the street, while
in the public square a throne was erected, and
when the Pope had taken his seat therein a
procession of children passed by, strewing
flowers at the feet of the Pope. Young men
and women sang songs in his honour, and
chanted hymns of his praise, midst clouds of
golden incense filling all the air. On the outskirts
of the crowd stood the miserable poor,
the half-starved peasants, the ragged children,
the miserable lepers. Their faces were gaunt,
their eyes hollow, their bread, crusts, their
garments, rags, and the spectacle of gluttony,
drunkenness and luxury, in contrast with the
vast multitude of starving poor, created such
a revulsion in the mind of the boy that from
that hour all should have known that it was
only a question of time when this gifted youth
would become an ascetic and a reformer.</p>

<p>The revulsion in the heart of Savonarola
was inevitably deepened by the lust and
cruelty laid to the door of the Church itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
That was a dark hour for the Papacy and
Italy. Paul II was a Venetian merchant,
greedy, ambitious, who, in middle age, saw
that the Pope was incidentally an ecclesiastic,
but essentially an emperor, a statesman and a
banker. Everything he touched in business
turned to gold. He had agents out in all the
world buying diamonds, pearls, rubies and
emeralds. He hired architects, sculptors and
painters, and made the church an art gallery.
"Once the church had wooden cups and plates
for the communion, but golden priests. Now,"
wrote Savonarola, "the church has golden
cups and plates, but wooden-headed priests."
The Rome of that time was a Rome of art and
vice, gold and blood, cathedrals and mud
huts. The least shocking page in the papal
history of the time describes Alexander
VI, and his son C&aelig;sare and his daughter
Lucretia, standing in the open window of the
papal palace, looking down into the courtyard,
filled with unlucky criminals. These
prisoners, sentenced to death, ran round and
round the court, while C&aelig;sare let fly his
arrows, and the Pope and Lucretia applauded
each lucky hit. The scene is one of many,
and the knowledge of such scenes inevitably
brought about rebellion in the soul of Savonarola.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>At the beginning of his career, the young
reformer attracted but little attention. He
entered a monastery and became a monk, and
his novitiate was chiefly marked by a fervour
of humilities. He sought the most menial
offices, and did penance for his sins by the
severest austerities. He was soon worn to a
shadow, but his gaunt features were beautified
by an expression of singular force and benevolence.
Luminous dark eyes sparkled and
flamed beneath his thick brows and his large
mouth was as capable of gentle sweetness as
of power and set resolve. But the spectacle
of the sensualism, drunkenness, cruelty, theft,
ignorance and wretchedness of Florence, that
had a handful of aristocrats at one extreme
and thousands of paupers at the other, gradually
filled his soul with burning indignation.
He began to see visions and to make prophecies
which afterward were mysteriously
fulfilled. His first success as a preacher came
when he was thirty-one and the following year
at Brescia, in a sermon on the Apocalypse, he
shook men's souls by his terrible picture of
the wrath to come. A halo of light was reported
to have been seen about his head, and
when, six years later, he returned to Florence,
to preach in the cathedral, his fame as an
orator had gone before him and the cloister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
gardens were too small to contain the crowds
that flocked to hear him.</p>

<p>The occasion of his first sermon in the
cathedral was one long remembered in the
city. The vast multitudes saw a gaunt figure
whose thick hood covered the whole head and
shoulders. From deeply sunken eye-sockets
there looked out two eyes that blazed as with
lightning. The nose was strong and prominent,
with wide nostrils, capable of terrible
distention under the stress of emotion. The
mouth was full, with compressed, projecting
lips, and large, as if made for a torrent of
eloquence. The speaker was a visionary, and
a seer. At one moment he melted his audience
to tears, at another he stirred them to horror,
again quickening their souls with prayer and
pleadings, that had in them the sweetness of
the very spirit of Christ. Soon the walls of
the church re&euml;choed with sobs and wailings,
dominated by one ringing voice. One scribe
explains fragments of the sermon with these
words: "Here I was so overcome with weeping
that I could not go on." The poet, Mirandola,
tells us that Savonarola's voice was like a clap
of doom: a cold shiver ran through the marrow
of his bones, and the hair of his head
stood on end as he listened. The theme that
morning was this: "Repent! A judgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
God is at hand. A sword is suspended over
you. Italy is doomed for her iniquity." The
speaker prophesied coming bloodshed, the ruin
of cities, the trampling down of provinces, the
passage of armies, and the devastating wars
that were about to fall on Italy.</p>

<p>The great man of Florence at this moment
was Lorenzo the Magnificent. Lorenzo was
the most powerful figure in Italy, the most
widely-travelled, and the richest man of
his time. Tiring of luxury and flattery, he
was ambitious to be called the patron of art
and literature. He had fitted up a great
banqueting-room in his palace, in which he
could assemble painters, sculptors, architects,
actors, poets, philosophers. His seat at the
head of the table was after the fashion of a
throne, and he had made himself a kind of
dictator in the realm of learning. Always
open to flattery, he was surrounded by a group
of citizens who never ceased burning incense
at the altar of his egotism. He was at once
a politician, a poet, an amateur actor, dramatist,
and singer. At his table sat Ficino, who
translated Plato's works into Latin, and Pico
della Mirandola, who was the idol of Florentine
society. It was the latter's boast that a
single reading fixed in his memory any
language, any essay or poem, and made it his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
forever. Other guests were Leo Alberti and
Leonardo, the two men of comprehensive
genius in all the group that lived in the palace
of the Prince. Constant adulation made
Lorenzo arrogant and vain to the last degree.
In disguise he led a group of dissipated young
men in the carnival f&ecirc;tes. He wrote licentious
carnival songs and so degraded were
his followers that they went everywhither
shouting his praises as a poet superior to
Dante. And when, in July of the following
year, Savonarola was elected Prior of St.
Mark's, Lorenzo sent messengers to him, bidding
him to show more respect to the head of
the State.</p>

<p>Savonarola refused to do so. One day the
Prince was seen walking in the garden of the
monastery. An attendant came in to Savonarola,
and announced that Lorenzo the Magnificent
was in the garden. "Does he ask for
me?" "No," replied the young monk.
"Then let him walk." Shortly afterward
the Prince sent a deputation to wait on the
new Prior, telling him that it was not good
form to preach against the Prince, who was
the patron of St. Mark's, to which Savonarola
replied, "Did I receive my position from
Lorenzo, or from Almighty God?" Savonarola's
eyes blazed, and he spake in tones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
thunder and the answer was, "From Almighty
God." "Then," went on the Prior,
"to Almighty God will I render homage."</p>

<p>Lorenzo, as it chanced, was drawing near
to the end of his life. One day a messenger
came from the palace announcing his dangerous
illness. Because Lorenzo had usurped
the liberties of his country, had robbed and
oppressed his own people, Savonarola would
not go. Then a second messenger came, saying
that the Prince was dying and asked absolution.
The Prior found the Prince propped
up upon velvet pillows, and lying in a great
silken chamber. All his life long, Lorenzo
had been accustomed to soft words and pliant
service. Now this stern prophet of duty
towered above his couch like a messenger of
God. The Prior told him absolution could
not be granted except upon certain conditions.
"Three things are required of you; you must
have a full and lively faith in God's mercy;
you must restore your ill-gotten gains; you
must restore liberty to Florence." Twice the
Prince assented, but the third time his face
went white. He shivered, as if in fear, and
at length, in silence, he turned his face toward
the wall. Savonarola turned his back. He
would not grant absolution. Lorenzo died.
The news was spread through the city by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
relatives and servants standing about the bedside
of the dead Prince. The event heaved
the soul of Florence as the tides heave the sea.</p>

<p>The Prior was now the most influential man
in Italy. His sermons took on a new boldness,
and his denunciation of vices filled the city
with excitement. Ever increasing his power
as a preacher, he now added certain addresses
as a patriot. He hated the tyranny of the
Medici with an undying hatred. Taking upon
himself full responsibility, he sent a letter of
welcome to Charles VIII and his French
army, believing that if Florence opened her
gates to the French, the Florentines might recover
their own liberty. Having expelled the
family of the Medici, he found it necessary
to write a constitution for Florence, and his
influence in shaping that constitution was the
most powerful influence exerted in that
critical time. Leaving to others the task of
writing the code, he told the people plainly
that, of necessity, a government by one man
strengthened the single ruler toward despotism
and autocracy, while self-government,
through the choice of representatives, worked
for the diffusion of strength and responsibility.
He proposed a grand council of 3,000
citizens appointed by the city judges, a body
that answers to our House of Representatives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
and another superior council of eighty citizens,
all over forty years of age, who, in turn,
were to share with the magistrates the task of
appointing the higher officers of the State.
Then he brought about a reform of taxation,
full amnesty for political offenders, made
usury a treasonable act, founded a bank that
loaned money to the poor on their character
and to the rich on their collateral. He organized
a movement against licentious plays,
against luxury, extravagance, ostentatious
dress and houses. And when the exiled
princes made an alliance with the Pope, he
denounced the crimes of the Papacy.</p>

<p>Little by little, a great moral revival swept
over Florence and Italy, a revival that culminated
in the coming together of the Florentines
in the public square, where the people
threw upon a blazing fire their vanities, with
all the implements of gambling, fraud, and
trickery, of vice and drunkenness. Without
being himself an ascetic, without making any
sweeping attack upon pleasure through music
or the drama, Savonarola was an opponent of
every form of sensuality, and the gilded vices
that undermine sound morals. He was first
of all a preacher, changing men's lives and,
incidentally, stating the reasons for their personal
reformation. Luther changed men's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
thinking first, and showed men why this was
wrong, and that was right, and therefore
wrought fundamental changes. But Savonarola
was less of a thinker and more of an
evangelist. He had all the action of Demosthenes,
all the earnestness of Peter the Hermit,
all the voice, the gestures and the manner of
Whitefield. He believed that the inevitable
end of sin was the Inferno of Dante, and therefore
his language was full of fire, his voice
full of tears, and he plead with men to
flee from Vanity Fair as Lot fled from
Sodom.</p>

<p>His uncompromising spirit had long since
aroused the hatred of political adversaries as
well as of the degraded court of Rome. Even
now, when his authority was at its height,
when his fame filled the land, and the vast
cathedral and its precincts lacked space for the
crowds flocking to hear him, his enemies were
secretly preparing his downfall. From the
beginning it was plain that Socrates was fighting
a losing battle against the wicked judges
of Athens. From the beginning it must have
been plain to Dante that his cunning and insidious
foes, who felt that he alone stood between
them and their own enrichment, would
drive him an exile from Florence. And when
Savonarola came into collision with Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Alexander VI, it was like a bird of paradise
going up against some Gibraltar of granite
and steel.</p>

<p>Pope Alexander's two ambitions were the
advancement of his family and the strengthening
of his temporal power. It was Alexander
who, knowing that the Sultan had a rival in
the person of the young Prince Djem, seized
the young noble and put him in jail, on condition
that forty thousand ducats yearly
should be paid for his jail fee. It was to
Alexander that, later, the Turk sent dispatches
offering three hundred thousand ducats if he
would do away with the youth. History has
extenuated many of the crimes of Alexander,
but this traffic in murder for the Turks can
never be forgiven. It was Alexander also who
made impossible liberty of the press, by forcing
printers to submit their books to the control
of archbishops. It was Alexander who
maintained a harem in the Vatican. It was
Alexander whose spies were in every inn, in
every village. His secret agents were in all
the audiences of Savonarola. Alexander
looked upon the Prior as a traitor, disloyal
and dangerous to the Papacy. At first he sent
agents to Florence, and offered bribes to
Savonarola, asked if he would accept a cardinal's
hat, and invited him to Rome to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the Vatican. Savonarola answered by redoubling
his attacks. He called Rome a harlot
church, till the Pope ordered his excommunication.
And at length, becoming alarmed for
their city, the magistrates of Florence forbade
Savonarola's preaching, and closed the cathedral
to his work.</p>

<p>Retiring to St. Mark's, the great leader
wrote letters to the crowned heads of Europe,
and called for a general council. He reviewed
the crimes of which the Pope had been
guilty, and the list of vices was long and
black. His letters to various princes were
intercepted, and taken to Alexander. Then
agents, with large sums of money, were sent to
Florence to organize a movement to destroy
the Prior. Every conceivable plot was organized
against him, but he escaped poison,
the knife, and the assassin's club. His enemies
challenged him to the ordeal by fire, and when
he asked that he might be allowed to carry the
crucifix and the sacrament in his hand they
withdrew the challenge. Thrown into prison,
the inquisitors subjected him to the most cruel
torture. He was drawn up to the ceiling by a
rope fourteen times, and then suddenly
dropped, until muscles, tendons and bones
were all but torn from their sockets. He was
denied food and water and sleep. And finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
his reason gave way. Bodily pain so injured
and inflamed the brain that it refused its action.
Among his last words were the words
of the dying Saviour, "In thee, O Lord, have
I trusted. Let me never be confounded."</p>

<p>When he was condemned to the flames, he
appealed to the government of Florence, but
the rulers hastened to support the papal decree,
and insisted upon the execution of the
sentence. On the morning upon which he was
to die, the great public square in Florence
was crowded with citizens. Multitudes who
had wept during his sermons and whose lives
had been changed by his teachings, stood in
grief and trepidation around the funeral pyre,
just as the multitudes in Jerusalem stood in
fear about the cross of Christ. In pronouncing
the sentence of death, the bishop of Verona,
overwhelmed with fear and confusion,
said, "I separate thee from the Church militant
and the Church triumphant." To
which Savonarola answered, "From the
Church militant, yes, but from the Church
triumphant, that is not given unto you."
The soldiers pushed the lowest dregs of the
city, thieves, drunkards, diseased criminals,
close to his scaffold, and encouraged them to
assail him with vile words and vile deeds. At
ten o'clock of the 23d of May, 1498, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
enemies achieved his death. Like Elijah he
ascended unto heaven in a chariot of fire.
But soon thereafter the guilty leaders of the
Church discovered that his work had just begun.
He had aroused the conscience of the
people, who followed Luther in a revolt
against the sale of indulgences that gave the
right for the crime and sin. His assertion
of personal liberty put strength into Luther's
arm and faith into the heart of Calvin.
Erasmus borrowed from Savonarola his teachings
of reasonableness and light. In exalting
the Bible as the final source of authority, he
had enthroned that Book and the teachings of
Jesus above all popes and cardinals and
bishops. Practical men, Galileo, and Bacon,
and Erasmus, and Tyndale, borrowed courage
from his life and writings. And to this day
the influence of this preacher, prophet,
martyr, is still potent, not alone in Italy, but
throughout the world.</p>

<h2>III<br />
WILLIAM THE SILENT<br />
(1533&ndash;1584)</h2>
<h3><i>And Brave Little Holland</i></h3>

<p>Be the reasons what they may, liberty owes
much to little lands and confined
peoples. Go back to any age and continent,
place side by side a little nation and a large
one, and if the first has made for liberty and
progress, the second has often made for bondage
and superstition. For the beginnings of
morals and religion we go back, not to that
widely extended state named Babylon, but to
little Palestine, shut in between the desert and
the deep sea. For the beginnings of art and
culture we go not to the vast, rich plains of
Asia Minor, but to that little rocky land
named Greece. For the beginnings of the republic
we go not to the sunny plains of Italy,
but to the narrow valleys between the Alpine
Mountains. What great contribution to civilization
has Russia made to the world?
But the little Swiss Republic has given us the
international postal system, international arbitration
and the referendum. Commerce owes
a great debt to little Venice. Modern banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
owes a great debt to little Scotland. Asia
and Africa owe a great debt to little England.
And though Holland was a narrow
strip of land but twenty miles wide and one
hundred miles long, yet the world can never
repay the debt it owes to this mother of
republics.</p>

<p>For lovers of liberty the most sacred spot
in modern Europe is the square of the Binnenhof
at The Hague. A tablet there records
the words with which William the Silent
challenged Philip II&mdash;words that were first
made the foundation of the Dutch Republic,
words that our pilgrim fathers took as the
basis of their New England institutions.</p>

<p>"We declare to you that you have no right
to interfere with the conscience of any one so
long as he has done nothing to work injury to
another person or public scandal."</p>

<p>We can never forget that Holland gave the
founders of our Republic their shelter, with
safety and leisure for working out their
dreams and visions of self-government. But
a full century before the Pilgrim Fathers set
foot in Leyden, Holland had become a shelter
to foreign exiles, and her citizens had pledged
themselves to a deathless hatred of all forms
of tyranny. To the cities of Holland had fled
those men who were denied liberty of thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
in Paris and Nuremburg. To Holland had
come the victims of oppression in Venice and
Florence. It was in Holland that the great
Humanist had lived and died, that scholar
and philosopher Erasmus, who wrought as
powerfully for reform in religion as Huss and
Savonarola. It was Erasmus who forged the
intellectual weapons used by Luther in Germany,
and Calvin in Geneva. It was Erasmus
who first made a correct text for the Greek
Testament. It was Erasmus who put the
Bible into the common languages of Europe.
And it was a group of Dutchmen who first
demanded the separation of Church and State.
Two generations before William Bradford
gathered his little band in Leyden, William
the Silent stood forth to challenge the divine
right of kings.</p>

<p>John Ruskin once called attention to the
fact that as every great art-age has been a
reaction from an era of unendurable ugliness,
so every movement for liberty has been a reaction
precipitated by unwonted tyranny.
Certain it is that as Oliver Cromwell represented
a rebound from feudalism, and Abraham
Lincoln a reaction from the cruelty of
slavery, so William the Silent represented a
thrilling protest against the crime of a foreign
usurper. His career is as romantic and many-coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
as the career of David, the fugitive,
fleeing from Saul, or that of Robert Bruce,
hiding in caves and dens from the pursuers
who threatened his life. In youth he was the
companion of kings, but he became the
champion of the people against their king, the
idol of his followers, and the hero of a lost
cause. Like David, he knew the weariness
and painfulness of the exile's lot. Like
Lincoln, he had a face furrowed with anxiety,
and fell a victim to the assassin's bullet.
Reared in luxury, the heir to titles and vast
estates, the head of a dynasty, whose blood still
flows in the veins of Europe's rulers, for the
cause of liberty he resigned his rank, that he
might serve the poor and oppressed. He was
a statesman, and had the foresight that organizes
out of defeat, and is unconquerable because
it never knows when it is defeated. He
was a reformer, and attacked injustice and despotism
in an era when of necessity his labours
were fruitless. He was a soldier, and had the
personal daring and the strong arm that count
for more than strategic skill. He was a hero,
and though daily the hired poisoners sought
entrance to his palace, and assassins ever
dogged his steps upon the streets, despite the
six attempts upon his life, he maintained his
courage and his boundless hope. In an age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
when society had not yet doubted the divine
right of kings, William of Orange fronted
Philip II with a denial of this citadel of
tyranny and injustice, affirmed the principle
that the creed of a nation and the creed of
individuals is a matter of their own choice and
their own conscience.</p>

<p>Our libraries hold no more instructive
volumes than Motley's story of the Netherlands,
their rise to material prosperity and
their struggle for liberty under the leadership
of this man known as William the Silent.
The tale of their slow growth as a maritime
nation is an epic of indomitable courage in the
face of every conceivable form of obstacle.
We see these people for the sake of liberty
retreating from the rich plains of central
Europe into the morass that the Roman historian
said was "neither land nor water."
With infinite labour they built barriers and
dikes against the North Sea, developed a
system of veins and arteries through which
they compelled the ocean to fertilize their
fields, and constructed watery highways for
carrying their commerce into distant lands.
At length a region outcast of earth and ocean
alike "wrestled from both domains their
richest treasure." Brave cities floated mermaid-like
upon the bosom of the sea. Standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
upon the canal boats, travellers looked
down upon cattle grazing below the level of
the ocean, beheld orchards and gardens whose
tree-tops scarcely reached the level of the
waves. Unconsciously this race that had
struggled so long and victoriously over storms
and seas was educating itself of the struggle
with the still more savage despotism of man.</p>

<p>With intelligence and enterprise came the
development of trade, and in the fifteenth
century the Hollanders became the carriers of
the world's commerce. Their ships and their
sailors made their way around into the
Baltic, to the ports of all northern Europe, to
the ports of France and Spain, of Genoa and
Naples and Venice, to Constantinople and
Alexandria, and from thence south into all
countries and continents. As bees flitting
from orchard to orchard fertilize the fruit, so
these ships passing from port to port and
continent to continent fertilized the minds of
men. Returning home they brought bulbs,
roots and seeds that soon made Holland the
gayest flower-garden in Europe and the home
of modern floriculture and horticulture.
From the Far East they brought the suggestion
of movable types. The bleached linens,
the tapestries and woollen goods of Holland
won fame throughout the world. The homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of her burghers were models of comfort and
even luxury. Small merchants of Amsterdam
and Leyden and Rotterdam became
merchant princes. Weavers and spinners of
linen and silk, workers in iron, as well as silver
and gold, left the other lands of Europe and
settled in the Dutch seaports.</p>

<p>In that little strip of land were inclosed
208 walled cities and 6,300 villages guarded
by a belt of sixty fortresses. Little wonder
that Spain looked longingly toward this people
and meditated plans for breaking down its
fortresses, subjugating its peoples and transferring
its accumulated treasure from the
chests of the burghers to the vaults of the
Spanish dons and cavaliers. And when at
length it began to look as if the scepter of the
sea might pass from Spain to Holland, King
Philip and his soldiers, under Bloody Alva,
resolved to draw a circle of fire around little
Holland and rob her of the treasure she had
so slowly earned.</p>

<p>Fully to understand the heroic struggle of
the Hollanders under William of Orange, we
must know the immediate cause of the controversy
and the source of the tyranny they
opposed. That cause was the Inquisition and
the tyranny was that of Spain's ambitious
rulers. At the moment of the outbreak, Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
was the richest and the most powerful nation
in Europe. Victorious in Africa and Italy,
her emperor had carried war into France and
now reigned over Germany as well as those
provinces now known as Belgium and Holland.
If we ask from whence Spain derived
the money for these wars of conquest the
answer is found in the vast treasure she
acquired in the New World. Prescott tells
us that when the Spanish soldiers captured
the capital of Peru, the soldiers spent days in
melting down the golden vessels which they
found in the vaults of temples and palaces.
In that era, when the yellow metal was worth
so much, a single ship carried to Spain $15,500,000
in gold, besides vast treasures of
silver and jewels. When Cortez approached
the palace of Montezuma the king's messengers
met the general bearing gifts from
their lord. These gifts included 200 pounds
(avoirdupois) of gold for the leader and two
pounds of gold for each soldier. The full
value of the treasure that Spain carried from
the cities and states of the New World will,
doubtless, never be known.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that the Spanish
soldiers who went into Mexico and Peru
turned those two countries into a wilderness.
For a full half-century these brutal soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
burning with avarice, went everywhither,
looting towns, pillaging cities, butchering the
people, lifting the torch upon cottage and
palace alike. The awful anguish and suffering
that Spain wrought upon the helpless
people of Mexico and Peru is one of the
bloodiest chapters in history. The eagle
pouncing upon the dove, the panther leaping
upon the young fawn, but faintly interpret to
us the savage cruelty of the Spaniard as he
raged through the new world. And when
the Spanish ships came home, laden with gold
and silver the Emperor found means to
prosecute his plans for military conquest.
Spanish armies were soon marching into
northern Italy, into Austria and Germany,
into France and finally into Holland.
Flushed with victory and greedy of Holland's
treasures, Philip determined to punish these
people for their refusal to vote supplies to his
army, by establishing there the Inquisition by
the sword.</p>

<p>The Inquisition, that medi&aelig;val instrument
for the detection of punishment of disbelievers
in the established Church, had existed in all
its horrible malignity for two hundred and
fifty years. But it remained for Philip of
Spain to make its name forever a byword and
a hissing in the mouth of history. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
begun by employing it against the wealthy
Jews and Moors, who made up the richest, the
most intelligent and prosperous classes in
Spain. During the first few years after its
institution the Spanish population fell from
10,000,000 to 7,000,000. In eighteen years
Torquemada burned 10,220 persons and confiscated
the property of 97,321 others. Primarily,
the Inquisition was a machine to
search men's secret thoughts. It arrested on
suspicion, "tortured for confession and then
punished with fire." One witness brought a
victim to the rack, and two to the flames.</p>

<p>The trial took place at midnight in a
gloomy dungeon dimly lighted by torches.
Lea tells us "the Grand Inquisitor was enveloped
in a black robe with eyes glaring at
his victim through holes cut in the hood."
Preparatory to examination, the victim,
whether man, maiden or matron, was stripped
and stretched upon a bench, after which all
the weights, pulleys, and screws by which
"tendons could be strained without cracking,
bones crushed without breaking, body tortured
without dying, were put into operation."
When condemnation was pronounced the
tongue was mutilated so that the victim could
neither speak nor swallow. When the morning
came, a breakfast with rare delicacies was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
placed before the sufferer and with ironical
invitation he was urged to satisfy his hunger.
Then a procession was formed, headed by the
magistrates, prelates and nobility, and the
prisoner was led to the public square, where
an address was given, lauding the Inquisition,
condemning heresy and warning the people
against want of subjection to the Pope and the
Emperor. Then while hymns were sung, blazing
fagots were piled about the prisoner until
his body was reduced to a heap of ashes.</p>

<p>Such was the devilish institution Philip of
Spain determined to set up in Holland as a
means of accomplishing his twofold aim, the
punishment of "disbelievers" and the despoiling
of the Dutch burghers' treasure-chests.
Little wonder that even this sturdy
folk drew back from the thought in horror.
They were not a people to submit to such
barbarities as they had already proved, by
giving shelter to foreign exiles. When the
Inquisition was first inaugurated in Spain,
and men first stretched upon the rack as
heretics, Holland had opened her doors to the
fugitives, who fled alike from the wrath of
kings and priests. All over the world, with its
darkness and superstition, its cruelty, its
flames, its racks and thumbscrews, men of independent
minds had secretly turned their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
thoughts toward little Holland, and their
steps toward the seaports where the Dutch
merchants bought and sold the treasures of
the sea. So, now, there developed in the
Netherlands a united protest, representing
tens of thousands of people, who deserted the
churches ruled by the officials of the Inquisition.
These protestors went into the open air
beyond the city walls where they sang songs,
and listened to the preaching of the reformed
ministers. Soon the Roman Catholics under
the guidance of the Spanish army, and the
Protestants under William of Orange, stood
over against one another like two castles with
cannon shotted to the muzzle. And finally
the storm broke, and the protestors went into
the churches their own hands had built, and
covered the floor with rubbish of broken
statues, effigies, and images, cleansing the
walls with axe and hammer and broom, and
leaving only the pulpit for the teacher, and
the plain pews for the worshippers.</p>

<p>The spark which finally set aflame the
powder-magazine of men's hearts was the entrance
into Holland, in 1567, of the Duke of
Alva, at the head of twenty thousand of
Spain's finest troops. Bloody Alva was
the most accomplished and capable general in
Europe. He had been victorious in campaigns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in Africa, Italy, France and Germany.
He has been called the most bloodthirsty man
who ever led troops to battle, and he was
sent to Holland to satiate his wolfish instincts.
His army included 6,000 horsemen, notorious
for the cruelty with which they had butchered
their captives in the Italian campaigns. Alva
promised to turn these human wolves loose
upon the sheep of Holland. Having arrived
in Antwerp and established himself in the
citadel, his first act was to organize the
"Bloody Council." This monster, whose
cruelty was never equalled by any savage
beast, announced that if in the Roman era the
Emperor contented himself with the heads of
a few leaders, leaving the multitude in safety,
<i>he</i> would order the death of the multitude,
naming a few who were to be permitted to live.
Soon the streets were filled with dead bodies.
Not content with hanging, burning, and beheading
the leaders, Alva hung the corpses
beside the road as a warning against free-thinking.</p>

<p>In seven brief years this man brought
charges of heresy, treason and insubordination
against 30,000 inhabitants. He boasted
that he had executed 18,600, while the number
of those who had perished by battle, siege,
starvation and butchery defied all computation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
And the more the people rebelled, the
more cruel were the methods he devised to
torment them. To the gallows he added the
stake and the sword. Men were beheaded,
roasted before slow fires, pitched to death with
hot tongs, broken on the wheel, flayed alive.
On one occasion the skins of leaders were
stripped from the living bodies and stretched
upon drums for beating at the funeral march
of their brethren to the gallows. The barbarities
committed during the sacking of starving
villages, Motley tells us are beyond belief.
"Unborn infants were torn from the living
bodies of their mothers; women and children
were violated by thousands; whole populations
burned and hacked to pieces by soldiers, and
every mode which cruelty in its wanton ingenuity
could desire."</p>

<p>Such was the administration of the man of
whom it was said: "He possessed no virtues,
while the few vices he had were colossal." To
Philip, Bloody Alva explained his failure
to subdue the Hollanders by the statement
that his "rule had been too merciful."</p>

<p>Over against this human monster, with his
implacable hatreds and his bestial cruelties,
stands William of Orange, the champion of
liberty and the saviour of the Netherlands.
By a strange coincidence, the first vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
picture we have of this prince who gave up a
life of ease and luxury to defend the rights of
his fellow men, is the scene at the abdication
of Charles V, when, in the presence of a great
multitude at Brussels, that ruler turned over
the sovereignty of the Netherlands to his son,
young Philip II of Spain. William of
Orange was then a youth of twenty-two, a
stadtholder, or imperial governor, of three
rich provinces, and the commander of the
official army on the French frontier.</p>

<p>"Arrayed in armour inlaid with gold," says
the historian, "with a steel helmet under his
left arm, he looked the picture of noble manhood."
Beside him, as he fronted the assemblage,
stood young Philip, a youth of twenty-eight,
dressed in velvet and gold, but physically
ill-shapen and already an object of
dislike and distrust. Impressive indeed the
contrast between these two young men, destined
in a few short years to be pitted against
each other like gladiators in the long struggle
for liberty. "The one had a genius for government,
the other possessed a talent for misgovernment.
William of Orange had a passion
for toleration; Philip II had a passion for
crushing every form of toleration." Sovereign
at twenty-eight, Philip was already a
prey to that consuming ambition which, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
his fierce bigotry, was soon to win him universal
hatred.</p>

<p>How different this young prince William,
with his godlike physique, his perfect balance
of heart and intellect, his conscience that
could not endure the thought of tyranny.
Little wonder that men loved him. In person
most elegant, in manners most accomplished,
he had been educated by his mother, Juliana
of Stolberg, a woman of rare abilities and
deeply religious character. As a <i>grand seigneur</i>,
with great estates and a brilliant retinue,
he had known every temptation of wealth
and luxury. But neither the flattery of his
friends nor the adulation of his followers had
sapped his manhood. He was already a seasoned
soldier, and almost at once he was to
win fame as a diplomatist. We see him serving
at the head of his troops throughout one
more campaign; then, at the age of twenty-six,
acting as one of the three plenipotentiaries
at the treaty of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis.
Sent to France as hostage for the fulfillment
of this treaty, we find him the cynosure of all
men's eyes at the greatest and most brilliant
court of the day. Little here to warn those
arch-plotters, Henry of France and Philip of
Spain, that he was soon to become their deadliest
foe. Yet already he was meditating rebellion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
against the horrors they were planning.
And soon he was to give up all thoughts of
court distinction, and go forth to organize
peasants and rebels into an army, besieging his
own castle in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>It was while he was still at the French
court that the incident took place which gave
him his title of William the Silent. The peace
between Henry and Philip had just been concluded,
with one purpose in view as advised
by cardinals and priests. "Both sovereigns
were to massacre the Protestants in their dominions,
and in the Netherlands the Spanish
troops were to be employed for this special
purpose." The Duke of Alva was in the
secret, and King Henry supposed that William
of Orange was also. One day while
hunting, with William riding at his side,
Henry of France unfolded the horrible scheme.
The young prince heard him without a word.
He had not been told of the project, but he
betrayed his ignorance by no sign of speech or
gesture. Henry assumed that he approved of
the awful butchery. No man was ever more
grievously in error. From that moment William
of Orange knew that his call had come,
from that hour he meditated his withdrawal
from the political parties of the guilty leaders.
And when at length the martyr fires were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
kindled in Holland, and the Inquisition, under
Bloody Alva, began its hellish tasks of
"Church discipline" William of Orange sold
his plate and jewels, abandoned the great
estates he had inherited, and throwing in his
lot with the common people, went to the defense
of the Netherlands in the struggle for
liberty of thought.</p>

<p>William had already intervened, at the risk
of his life, on more than one occasion of strife
and bloodshed. But the harshness with which
the laws against heretics were now carried out,
the presence of Spanish troops, the filling up
of ministerial offices by Spaniards and other
foreigners was stirring the whole country, and
presently his own son, studying at the University
of Louvain, was seized and carried off
to Spain. William himself was outlawed and
his property confiscated. Finding that he had
been for years the real head of the movement
for liberty, Alva, as Governor-General, now set
a price upon his head. It was the darkest
hour of the long struggle. In constant danger
of assassination, in constant fear of betrayal,
unable to convince his own people that
the contest could never be won, William
wandered from place to place, a fugitive and
an exile.</p>

<p>But he never once lost heart or capitulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to despair. In that hour he seemed to have
the strength of ten. He was at once general,
statesman, diplomat, financier and saviour of
his people. Like David, he went through the
forest collecting outlaws and men who had
grievances; he organized a score of bands to
prey upon the Spanish army; he developed a
system of secret service by which he kept
spies in Alva's citadel and informed his people
of the enemy plans. He raised a little
army&mdash;saw it defeated&mdash;raised another, and
saw the crafty Alva refuse to fight until he
was forced to allow it to disband. In seven
years he organized four such armies, only to
be overwhelmed again and again by force of
numbers. With peasants armed with pikes
and pistols he fought veterans who had guns,
cannons and 6,000 horses. Attempt after
attempt was a failure, but he would not confess
defeat. When all seemed lost, he wrote
to his brother, "With God's help, I am determined
to go on." And at length, in the
face of defeat on land, he turned to the sea
and, organizing his little fleet of "Beggars,"
became a terror to the Spanish galleons.</p>

<p>Fascinating the story of how this term, "the
Beggars," came to be the watchword of the
Hollanders' revolt. One day when the clouds
were at their blackest, the nobles of Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
rode in a body to the Duchess Margaret to
beseech the withdrawal of the Spanish troops.
They came plainly dressed and unarmed, and
marching four abreast into the council chamber,
petitioned her to suspend the Inquisition.
While Margaret, deeply touched, shed tears
over the piteous appeal, one of her counsellors,
named Berlaymont, spoke scornfully of the
petitioners as "a troop of beggars." The
dropping of that single word was like the
dropping of a spark into a powder-magazine.
That night a banquet was held, with three
hundred nobles present, and "Long live the
Beggars!" rose on every side. Born of a
jibe, the name "Beggars" caught the imagination
of the people; the revolt spread like
wild-fire, and henceforth the phrase became a
battle-cry, which was to ring out on every
bloody field of the long struggle.</p>

<p>But the battle was only begun. Though
the spring of 1572 brought hope, the hope was
quickly dashed by the news of the terrible
massacre of St. Bartholomew in France.
Charles IX had aligned himself with Philip of
Spain and was seeking to exterminate the
Protestants. And Bloody Alva now redoubled
his cruelties in Holland. With incredible
ferocity, he attacked and captured the city
of Naarden, butchering every man, woman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and child, and razing every building to the
ground. Haarlem was next marked for destruction.
The garrison, numbering less than
two thousand men, was reinforced by Catherine
van Hasselaar and her corps of three
hundred women, who handled spade and pick,
hot water and blazing hoops of tar during the
assaults. Alkmaar came next. Sixteen thousand
Spaniards under Don Frederic, Alva's
son, began the siege, expecting the town to fall
as Haarlem had. But the hated foreigners
were met in the breaches by women, boys and
girls, who fought with pick, stones, fire and
hot water for a full month.</p>

<p>When the brutal Spanish troops threatened
to beat the patriots down by sheer force of
numbers, the peasants cut their dikes, flooded
their own fields and homes and renewed the
attack upon the Spaniards from the branches
of their orchards and the tops of their houses.
Clinging to the dikes by their finger-tips,
these people fought their way back into the
marshes, where the ground was more solid
beneath their feet. No pen can describe and
no brush can paint the scenes of this and the
other sieges that followed. The history of
heroism holds no more impressive spectacle
than the sight of these patriots who, in the
hour when the siege was suddenly lifted, left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
their dead in the streets and went staggering
toward the church to give thanks to God and
swear anew their hatred of tyranny before
their lips had even tasted bread.</p>

<p>The struggle went on for a score of years.
Driven out of their homes, with no shelter of
tent or stable, fleeing constantly from the
enemy, hiding under the slough grass and
digging holes in the frozen sand, the patriots
perished by the thousands. In winter, when
the frost was bitter, and Alva looked out upon
ice on every side, he ordered thousands of
pairs of skates, that his men might the more
easily hunt down the fugitives. At the climax
of the struggle William the Silent, worn with
excessive labours, his health undermined by
weeks and months spent in the swamps and
in the dikes, was stricken with fever and all
but died. When the illness was at its height
and he was only a skeleton, too weak to hold
his pen in his hand, able only to whisper dispatches
to his messengers, came the news that
Leyden, already besieged for months, and now
plague-stricken, was about to surrender.</p>

<p>The Spaniards were determined to win this
defiant city, for it was the very heart of Holland
and the most beautiful city in the
Netherlands. It lay below the level of the
ocean, protected by great dikes, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
canals, shaded on either side by lime trees,
poplars, and willows, were crossed by one
hundred and forty-five bridges. Its houses
were beautiful, its public square spacious, its
churches imposing. The Spanish commander
had built sixty-six forts around the city and
so severe was the blockade that no succour by
land was possible. There were no troops in
the town, save a small corps of freebooters and
five companies of the burgher guards. "The
sole reliance of the city was on the stout
hearts of its inhabitants within the walls, and
on the sleepless energy of William the Silent
without." William, assuring them of deliverance,
had implored them to hold out at
least three months, and they had "relied on
his calm and unflinching soul as on a rock of
adamant." They were unaware of his illness,
for he had said nothing of it in his messages,
knowing that it would cast a deeper
shadow on the city.</p>

<p>When the word reached him that the besieged
could hold out no longer, he decided
once more to call in the aid of the sea. Leyden
lay fifteen miles from the ocean, but the
ocean could be brought to Leyden, and though
he had no army with which to overwhelm the
besiegers he still had his veteran "Beggars"
and a tiny fleet of vessels. He determined to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
sacrifice the neighbouring countryside, with
its houses and villages, its fields and flocks, if
only he might save the heroic city and its
defenders. On a day in August, the great
sluices were opened and the ocean began to
pour in over the land. While he still lay
desperately ill, waiting for the rising of the
waters, his agents were busy assembling a
fleet of flat-bottomed boats laden with herring
and bread for the starving people.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, within the city all was silence
and death. Pestilence stalked everywhere
and the inhabitants fell like grass beneath
the scythe. The only communication
was by carrier pigeons, and only the messages
from William kept up the hearts of the
defenders. The scenes of tragedy within the
walls are not to be described. And by a
stroke of evil fate the wind, blowing steadily
in the wrong direction, delayed the rising of
the waters.</p>

<p>Even in its despair, the city was sublime.
At the climax of its sufferings, a committee
waited on the burgomaster to advise surrender.
He was a tall, haggard, imposing
figure, with dark visage and commanding
eyes. He waved his broad-leafed hat for
silence, and then, to use Motley's words, gave
answer, "What would ye, my friends, why do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
ye murmur, that we do not break our vows,
and surrender the city to the Spaniards&mdash;a
fate more terrible than the agony which she
now endures? I tell you I have made an
oath before the city, and may God give me
strength to keep my oath! I can die but
once; whether by your hands, the enemy's, or
by the hand of God. My own fate is indifferent
to me; not so that of the city entrusted
to my care. I know that I shall starve, if
not soon relieved, but starvation is preferable
to the dishonourable death which is the only
alternative. Your menaces move me not; my
life is at your disposal; here is my sword,
plunge it into my breast; and divide my flesh
among you. Take my body to appease your
hunger, but expect no surrender so long as
I remain alive."</p>

<p>Then came a gale from the northwest, and
when the waters were piled up in huge waves,
the ocean swept across the ruined dikes. The
flotilla of the "Beggars," that had waited
outside, unable to advance, a painted fleet
upon a painted ocean, now surged forward in
a wild rush to save the city. Spaniards by
the hundreds sank beneath the deepening and
treacherous flood. The fortress of Alva was
destroyed. At midnight the enemy deserted
their redoubts and fled, and at daybreak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
ships of William the Silent came through the
canals. Soldiers threw bread to the starving
citizens, and two hours later every living person
who could walk made his way to the
church to sing a hymn of deliverance, during
which the multitude broke down and wept like
children. The day following, the wind shifted
to the east, and blew a tempest. "It was,"
says the historian, "as if the waters having
done their work of redemption, had been
rolled back by an omnipotent hand, and when
four days had passed the land was bare again,
and the reconstruction of the dikes well advanced."</p>

<p>Such was the spirit of William the Silent,
and his followers. The eventual outcome was
inevitable. At length the Spaniards came to
see that victory could be bought at one price
and one price alone&mdash;extermination. From
Spain came overtures to William of Orange.
His reply is historic: "Peace only upon three
conditions: (1) Freedom of worship, (2) A
land dedicated to liberty, (3) All Spaniards
in civil and military employment to be withdrawn
forever." In April, 1576, an act of
Union was agreed and signed at Delft, by
which supreme authority was conferred upon
him. In September of that year William
entered Brussels in triumph, as the acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
leader of all the Netherlands, Catholic
and Protestant alike. And at length, at
Utrecht, a federal republic was established,
with a written constitution&mdash;that republic
which was to exist for two hundred years
under the motto "by concord little things
become great." William's struggle was over
and the battle won.</p>

<p>But, all unconsciously, the architect of the
new republic was moving toward his end.
Like Moses, if he had led the people out of the
wilderness it was not given him to see the
promised land. For years his steps had been
dogged by hired assassins. There had scarcely
been an hour during his long warfare when
bribes and gold were not offered for his death.
It was a miracle that he had escaped the
dagger, the club and the cup of poison. He
was now fifty-one years of age. His portraits
exhibit him as a man whose lips were locked
with iron, whose face was furrowed with care,
his look alert and strained, his air that "of a
man at bay, having staked his life and life's
work." And yet he was one of the most
charming of companions, brilliant of address,
of so winning a manner that it was said
"every time he took off his hat he won a subject
from the King of Spain."</p>

<p>One morning, while writing at his desk, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
young Spaniard who had forged the seals
obtained access to the Prince's writing room.
Because he had been searched by the guard the
visitor was without weapon. But having delivered
his forged letter, he asked the Prince
for a Bible and the loan of a few crowns. He
received a gift of twelve pieces of silver, and
went into the courtyard, where, with the
Prince's own money, he purchased a pistol
from the guard. Thence he returned to find
a hiding place in the dark passageway, and to
empty three shots into the Prince's breast.</p>

<p>With the death of William the Silent the
Netherlands lost their noblest hero, their most
sublime patriot, and one of the greatest leaders
of all time. Few are the names worthy to be
ranked with that of this Prince of the blood
who gave his wealth, his strength and finally
his life for the cause of liberty. Ruling with
a strong hand, he was not a despot; brave, he
was not reckless; giant, he was also gentle;
warring against the Inquisition, with its
thumbscrews and fagots, he held himself
back from bloodthirstiness and revenge. The
victim of every kind of attack that hate could
devise or malignity invent, he never degraded
himself by meeting hate with hate or crime
with crime. When the long struggle for liberty
which he began was brought to an issue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Spain had buried 350,000 of her sons and
allies in Holland, spent untold millions for the
destroying of freedom, and sunk from the
ranks of the first power in Europe to the
level of a fourth-rate country&mdash;stagnant in
ideas, cruel in government, superstitious in
religion. But brave little Holland had
emerged to serve forever as a rock against
tyranny and a refuge from oppression.</p>

<h3><i>And the Rise of Democracy in England</i></h3>

<p>Society's ingratitude to its heroes and
leaders is proverbial. Earth's bravest
souls have been misunderstood in youth,
maligned in manhood and neglected in old
age. The fathers slay the prophets, the children
build the sepulchres, and the grandchildren
wear deeply the <a name="path" id="path"></a>path the heroes
trod. History teems with illustrations of this
principle. Socrates is the wisest prophet, the
noblest teacher, the truest citizen and patriot
that Athens ever had, and Athens rewards him
with a cup of poison. In a critical hour
Savonarola saves the liberty of his city, and
Florence burns him in the market-place.
Cervantes writes the only world-wide thing in
Spanish literature, and for an abiding place
Spain rewards him, not with a mansion, but
with a blanket in a dungeon, feeds him, not
upon the apples of Paradise, but on the apples
of Sodom, and gives him to drink, not the
nectar of the gods, but vinegar mingled with
gall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>Next to the Bible in influence upon English
literature comes the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>.
England kept John Bunyan in jail at Bedford
for twelve years, as his reward. For some
reason, nations reserve their wreaths of recognition
until the heart is broken, until hope
is dead, and the ambitions are in heaven. The
history of the other great leaders, therefore,
leads us to expect that the greatest, because
the most typical, Englishman of all time, shall
be unique in his obloquy and shame, as he was
signal in his supreme gifts. During his life
the very skies rained lies and cruel taunts; in
his death the mildewed lips of slander took up
new falsehoods. In the grave the very dust
of this hero furnished a sure foundation for
the temple of liberty, but his grave was
despoiled. With pomp and pageantry Charles
the Second ordered his bones to be exhumed,
and the skeleton hung between thieves at
Tyburn to satisfy his hatred. For twelve
years Cromwell's skull was elevated upon a
pole above Westminster Hall, where it stood
exposed to the rains of twelve summers and
the snows of twelve winters.</p>

<p>And now that two hundred and fifty years
have passed away, these centuries have not
availed for extinguishing the fires of hatred
and controversy, or for doing justice to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
memory of this man, Oliver Cromwell, God's
appointed king.</p>

<p>We would naturally expect that time would
have availed to clear the name and fame of
Cromwell and to secure for him the recognition
that his achievements deserve. But it
was hard for some royalists to forgive this man
who turned his hand against the sacred person
of the King. For nearly three centuries the
conflict has raged. The royal historians count
Cromwell the greatest hypocrite in history, the
trickster, the regicide, the political Judas of
all time. For a hundred years after his death,
no man was found brave enough to mention
the name of Oliver Cromwell in Windsor
Castle or the House of Lords. England's
Abbey has made a place for the statues of that
one-talent general, Burgoyne, whose chief
business was to surrender his troops to our
colonial soldiers, but the Abbey has no niche
for a bust of the only English general who
ranks with the great soldiers of history&mdash;Alexander,
C&aelig;sar, Napoleon, Grant, and now
Foch&mdash;these six and no more.</p>

<p>The British Houses of Parliament are
crowded with statues of politicians who gave
the people what they wanted, and some statesmen
who gave the people what they ought to
have. And there, too, are found the busts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
kings and queens, Bloody Mary, contemptible
John, those little feeblings and parasites
named the Georges. But low down and bespattered
with mud she has written the name
of her greatest monarch, and the most powerful
ruler that ever sat upon a throne.</p>

<p>Not until Carlyle came forward did the
cloud of slander begin to lift. When the three
hundredth anniversary of the birth of Cromwell
was celebrated, Great Britain awakened
to the fact that too little recognition had been
given to the great reformer whose career was
one of the marvels of English history. The
measure of a nation's greatness is the kind of
man it admires. To-day, it is of little consequence
what we think of Cromwell, but it is
of the first importance that Cromwell should
approve the leaders of our world-capitals.
Only in the last generation has the tide turned,
and the reaction begun to set in. John Morley,
busied with his biography of Gladstone,
took time to write a history of the man whom
he calls the maker of English history. Professor
Gardiner asserts that England has done
injustice to Cromwell and that the time has
come for her to right a great wrong. All the
world has at last begun to recognise the fact
that the farmer of Huntingdon was an uncrowned
king, ruling of his own natural right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>The world's ingratitude to Cromwell becomes
the more striking when we remember
what he did for Great Britain, for her people,
to right the wrongs of her poor, to found her
free institutions and to give her a place among
the nations of the earth. Oliver Cromwell
found England almost next to nothing in the
scale of European politics. France pitied poor
little England, and Spain, the one world-wide
force of the time, despised her. He found her
people a group of quarrelling sects, divided,
hostile and full of hate. Her soil was scored
with countless insurrections; her commerce
was dead; her navy was so miserably weak
that pirates sailed up the Thames, dropped
anchor in the night in front of Westminster
Hall, and flung defiance to the frightened
merchants. In a single year, three thousand
Englishmen were impressed by these pirates
and sold in the slave markets of Algiers,
Constantinople and the West Indies. He
found the king a tyrant, who one day made
the boast that he had brought every man who
had opposed his will to the Tower or the
scaffold. He found Parliament saying, "We
have struggled for twenty years, and every
attempt has ended with a halter, and it is
better to endure a present ill than flee to
others that we know not of."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>And in the very darkest hour of England's
history, this farmer flung himself into the
breach and besought his countrymen to unite
in one supreme effort to achieve liberty for
the common people. For forty years he had
been a plain country gentleman, content with
his farm; ten years later he was "the most
famous military captain in Europe, the greatest
man in England, and the wisest ruler
England ever had." He lived to hold the
destinies of his country in his hands, to enthrone
justice and toleration over a great part
of Europe, received overtures for alliances
from many kings, and died in the royal palace
at Whitehall, and was buried amid the lamentations
of many who had been his bitter
enemies.</p>

<p>Cromwell's greatness stirs our sense of
wonder the more, because he accomplished
what others had sought to achieve and failed.
Balfour or Lloyd George trained for years to
his task, is like one who stands in the midst of
an arsenal, protected by walls and battlements,
and served by cannon and machine guns. To
employ Carlyle's expressive figure, a dwarf
who stands with a match before a cannon can
beat down a stronghold, but he must be a
giant indeed who can capture an armed fortress
with naked fists, as did Oliver Cromwell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
He lived in an age of great men. The era
of Shakespeare, of Marlowe, Jonson and
Bacon was closing. It was the era of John
Pym, called "The Old Man Eloquent." It
was the era of Hampden, the patrician, the
orator and hero. It was the time of Sir Harry
Vane, the distinguished gentleman who came
to Boston to be made ruler of that new city,
and whom Wendell Phillips called the noblest
patriot that ever walked the streets of the
new capital. Coke was on the bench, meditating
his decisions, while Lyttleton was perfecting
his interpretations of the Constitution.
John Milton was making his plea for the liberty
of the press. Owen and Sherlock and
Howe were in the pulpits.</p>

<p>These were among the bravest spirits that
have ever stood upon our earth. All hated
tyranny, and all loved liberty. All sought to
overthrow the rule of the despot and yet,
when all had done their best, England was sold
like a slave in the market-place. It was the
farmer of Huntingdon who, in that critical
hour, came forward and showed himself equal
to the emergency. It was this country gentleman,
without political experience, this general
who became a statesman without the discipline
of statecraft, who became the shepherd
of his people and overthrew that citadel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
of iniquity called the Divine Right of Kings;
who rid England of her pirates, developed a
great commerce, built up the most powerful
navy that then sailed the sea&mdash;a possession
England has never lost&mdash;corrected the code,
rectified the Constitution, laid the foundation
for the present Bill of Rights. This is why
John Morley asks us to study carefully the
lineaments of this man whose body England,
to her undying shame, and in the days of her
dishonour, hung in chains at Tyburn.</p>

<p>If we are to understand Cromwell's character
and career and his place among the
world's leaders, we must recall his age and
time and the England of that far-off day,
when he wrought his work and dipped his
sword in heaven. What of the religious condition
of England in the era of intolerance,
when the prophet of God was anointed with
the ointment of war, black and sulphurous?
It is the year 1630, and Cromwell is still in
his early manhood. One bright morning, with
St. Paul's to his back, Cromwell entered
Ludgate Circus. In the midst of the circus
stood a scaffold and around it was a great
throng, crowding and pressing toward the
place of torture. At the foot of the scaffold
was a venerable scholar, his white hair flowing
upon his shoulders, a man of stainless character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and spotless life, renowned for his devotion,
eloquence and patriotism. When the
executioner led the aged pastor up the steps,
the soldiers tore off his garments. He was
whipped until blood ran in streams down his
back, both nostrils were slit and his ears
cropped off, hot irons were brought and two
letters, "S-S"&mdash;sower of sedition&mdash;were
burned into his forehead.</p>

<p>What crime had this pastor committed?
Perhaps he had lifted a firebrand upon the
King's palace; perhaps he had organized some
foul gunpowder plot to overthrow the throne
itself. Perhaps he had been guilty of treason,
or some foul and nameless sin against the
State. Not so. The reading of the decision of
the judge and the decree of the punishment
made clear the truth. It seemed that a fortnight
before, the aged pastor had been commanded
to give up his extempore prayers and
the singing of the Psalms, and had been commanded
to read the written prayers and sing
the hymns prescribed by the state Church.
But the gentle scholar had disregarded the
command, and on the following Sunday
walked in the ways familiar and dear to him
by reason of long association. He had dared
to sing the same old Psalms and lift his heart
to God in extempore prayer, after the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
of his fathers. And when the executioner
announced that on the following Saturday at
high noon the old scholar would be brought a
second time into Ludgate Circus, and there
scourged before the people, the cloud upon
Oliver Cromwell's brow was black as the
thunder-storm that stands upon the western
sky, black and vociferous with thunder.
Kings, the head of the Church of Jesus
Christ!</p>

<p>Two hundred years later, Abraham Lincoln,
standing in the market-place of New Orleans,
was to see a coloured child torn from its
mother's arms, held by the auctioneer upon the
block and sold to the highest bidder. With a
lump in his throat, Abraham Lincoln turned
to his brother and said: "If the time ever
comes when I can strike, I will hit slavery as
hard a blow as I can." And when Cromwell
turned away from that scene in Ludgate Circus
he went home to dream about the era of
toleration and liberty and charity, and registered
a vow to strike, when the time came,
the hardest blow he could against the citadel
of intolerance and bigotry on the part of the
Church.</p>

<p>But political England was as dark and
troublesome as the religious world of that day.
One of the noblest men of the time was Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
John Eliot. He was the child of wealth and
opportunity. The university had lent him culture,
travel had lent breadth, and leisure had
given him the opportunity to grow wise and
ripe. His nature was singularly lofty and
devout, his temper ardent and chivalric. His
one ambition was to serve his mother country.
A vice-admiral, he was given power to defend
the commerce of the country and overthrow
the pirates. After many attempts, by a clever
but dangerous maneuver he entrapped the
king of the pirates, Nutt, who had taken one
hundred and twenty English ships and sold
the sailors in the slave market of Algiers and
Tripoli. But King Charles freed the pirate,
and punished the vice-admiral by four months'
imprisonment, for he had taken bribes against
his own sailors.</p>

<p>When Sir John Eliot had been released, he
charged the King with complicity in a crime.
For reply the King levied an illegal fine. Sir
John Eliot was rich, and he might have
bought immunity. In his home dwelt a
beautiful wife and little children, and with
flight he might have escaped his prison. His
wealth would have enabled him to live abroad
in ease, but he preferred to stay at home and
die in London Tower for principle. And no
martyr, going to his stake, no hero, falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
at the head of a battle line, ever did a nobler
thing than Sir John Eliot, when he refused
to pay his fine and preferred death to enjoying
the pleasures of expediency for a season.
For three years the hero bore his imprisonment
and endured the tortures of confinement.
The rigours of the Tower could not break his
dauntless spirit. One day he found blood
upon his handkerchief. Fearing that death
was near, he sent a request to the royal palace.
"A little more air, your majesty, that I may
gain strength to die in!" But John Eliot had
thwarted the King's policy, and Charles carried
his vindictiveness even to death. "Not
humble enough," was the King's reply. Blows
cannot break the will, waters cannot drown
the will, flames cannot consume the will, and
in the hour of Eliot's death, Charles knew
that his opponent had conquered. One day
John Eliot's son petitioned the King that he
might carry his father's remains to Cornwall
to lie with those of his ancestors. Charles
wrote on the petition: "Let Sir John Eliot's
body be buried in the parish where he died,
and his ashes lie unmarked in the Chapel of
the Tower."</p>

<p>But the social England of the era of Cromwell
is a darker picture still. If our age is
the era of the rise and reign of the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
people, that was an age when the middle-class
was as yet almost unknown. Feudalism still
survived. There were the plebeians on the one
hand, and the patrician class on the other.
Theoretically the King owned the land, and
the lords and gentlemen were agents under
him. Kenilworth Castle and its lord stand for
the social England of that day. My lord dwelt
in a castle&mdash;the people dwelt in mud huts.
He wore purple and fine linen&mdash;his people
wore coats of sheepskin, slept on beds of
straw, ate black bread, knew sorrow by day
and misery by night. Did a farmer sow a
field and reap the harvest? Every third
shock belonged to the lord of the castle. Did
the husbandman drive his flocks afield? In
the autumn, every third sheep and bullock
belonged to my lord. Was the grain ripe in
the field? If the peasant owed twenty days'
labour without return at the time of sowing to
my lord, he had to give ten days more to the
lord of the castle in the time of the harvest.
Again without recompense. And so it generally
came about that for want of proper time
to plough and plant and for opportunity of
reaping in the hour when his grain was ripe,
the serf fronted the winter with an empty
granary, and the cry of his children was exceeding
bitter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>There were few bridges across the streams,
there was no glass in the farmer's window, not
one in a thousand owned a book, sanitation
was almost unknown, every other babe died in
infancy; if the upper classes came out of the
Black Death almost unscathed, about a third
of the peasant class was swept off by that
scourge, which the physicians now know was
caused by insufficient food and decayed grain.
It was an era of ignorance and brutality
among the poor, an era of snobs and of
criminals. Cromwell found a hundred laws
upon the English statute books that involve
hanging for petty infringements against the
rights of the King. He found woman a chattel
and one day saw a man sell his wife in the
market-place and beheld the purchaser lead
the girl off in a halter. When the traveller
rode up to London, he passed between a line of
gibbets, where corpses hung rotting in chains.
Highwaymen rode even into London, at nightfall,
and tied their horses in Hyde Park,
robbed people in the streets, broke into stores
and rode away unmolested. One advertisement
read thus: "For sale, a negro boy, aged
eleven years. Inquire at the Coffee House,
Threadneedle Street, behind the Royal Exchange."</p>

<p>Drunkenness and gambling were all but universal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
One Secretary of State was notorious
as the greatest drunkard and the most unlucky
gambler of his era. A Prime Minister
was allowed to appear at the opera house with
his mistress, and was esteemed the finest public
man of his century. We are face to face
with corruption in politics, incompetence in
council and paganism in religion. To-day a
member of the Cabinet who would use his
private information for purposes of gambling
in Wall Street would be instantly ruined.
But in that era, the King and his courtiers
filled their coffers by such methods without
any criticism.</p>

<p>In such an era, Cromwell saw that there was
no hope for England until there was a middle
class. He determined to destroy the castles
that offered shelter to the princes who had
spoiled and robbed and outraged the poor,
who had no defense to which they could flee
when they had outraged the law. It has often
been said that he was an iconoclast; in razing
the castles of England to the ground and
overthrowing the strongholds he was the
greatest criminal of his age; but if he loved
the castles and architecture less, it was because
he loved the poor more. He levelled
stones down that he might have a foundation
upon which the poor could climb up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
thereby he destroyed the strongholds of feudalism
and laid the foundations of the Bill of
Rights of 1832, and was the forerunner of our
own Washington and Lincoln.</p>

<p>Who is this King Charles who stands for the
old order, and who is the great representative
of the doctrine of the divine right of kings?
He was a grandson of Mary, Queen of Scots,
who, in fleeing from Scotland, seized the hand
of Lord Lindsay, her foe, and holding it aloft
in her grasp swore by it, "I will have your
head for this, so I assure you." His father
was James the First of England and Sixth of
Scotland, who had some gifts and also virtues,
but who after all was simply an animated
stomach, carried far by a handful of intellectual
faculties. That Charles the First had
qualities denied to his father all must confess.
He was gifted with a certain taste for pictures,
he had some imagination, and loved good literature.
During his imprisonment he read
Tasso, Spenser's <i>Faerie Queen</i>, and, above all,
Shakespeare. He was methodical and decorous,
but his favourite essay was Bacon's
"Essay on Simulation and Dissimulation."
As a diplomat he believed that Machiavelli's
<i>Prince</i> was the ideal to be followed, in that
truth is so precious a quantity that it ought
not to be wasted on the common people. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was not renowned for chivalry or a sense of
gratitude. Witness his foul desertion of
Strafford in the hour when Strafford exclaimed:
"Put not your trust in princes!"</p>

<p>Again and again, through his selfishness, he
spoiled his people. To obtain money he sold
to one of his favourites the exclusive right to
use sedan chairs in London, and put chains
across the streets and made it a criminal
offense for a gentleman to drive his coach into
the limits of the city. He taxed the shoes the
people wore, the salt they ate, the beds on
which they slept, and the very windows
through which the light came. He hired spies
to make out a list of merchants who had an
income of more than &pound;2,000 a year and by
indirect blackmail obtained money therefrom.
When the Black Death broke out, and the
streets of London were piled with corpses, and
the committee of relief asked for public subscriptions,
Charles the First fled to Hampton
Court and made no subscription, large or
small, to the relief fund.</p>

<p>And how did he amuse himself during those
days when every house in London was left
desolate? In his far-off palace, surrounded
by guards, beyond whom no messenger could
pass, Charles the First sat, surrounded by his
court. He sent to Amsterdam for jewellers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
and paid &pound;10,400 for a necklace. He paid
&pound;8,000 for a gold collar for himself, and &pound;10,000
for a diamond ring for the Queen. On
the ground that Parliament had not imposed
taxes sufficient for his expenses, he made a
tax proclamation for himself. Then Parliament,
led by Pym and Hampden and Eliot,
brought in a bill of remonstrance. They assumed
that the King ruled under pre&euml;xisting
laws. They declared that if Charles refused
to call a Parliament and arrogated its power
to himself, twelve peers might call a Parliament,
and if this failed, the citizens might
come together through a committee and elect
their representatives.</p>

<p>But the King was consumed with egotism
and vanity. He sent orders to Parliament to
deliver to him the five leaders who stood for
the liberties of the people, and with a mob of
soldiers he entered the House of Commons to
seize Hampden and Pym. But the House
refused to give up its members, and helped
them to escape through one of the windows,
and the next day it brought them back in a
triumphal procession. Returning to his palace,
the King found the streets crowded with
people, silent, sullen, dark with anger. He
heard threats and growls from every side.
One prophet of righteousness called out, "To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
your tents, O Israel!" Suddenly Charles the
First realized that his people, driven to bay,
had at last bestirred themselves, and, fearing
he might be driven into a corner, his cheek
went white as marble. That night, conscious
of his danger, he fled to Hampton Court, while
the whole city applauded the five leaders who
had escaped the snare. He had furnished the
dynamite to blow up his throne. The people,
represented by Parliament, stood over against
the peers, represented by the King, as enemies.
It was "either your neck, or my neck," and
when a few weeks passed, there began the era
of civil war, with blazing towns and castles
and strongholds. "Whom the gods would
destroy, they first make mad."</p>

<p>But who is the man who shall do for England
what Savonarola did for Florence, and
Luther for Germany, and William Tell for
Switzerland, and Washington and Lincoln for
our own country? Oliver Cromwell was of
Celtic stock and noble family. It is a singular
coincidence that he was a ninth cousin of that
Charles whose death warrant he was to sign;
that seventeen of his relatives were in Parliament
to sign the Great Remonstrance, and that
ten of his blood-relatives joined with him in
signing the death warrant of the King. Cromwell
was sixteen years of age, and enrolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
himself as a student at Cambridge on the very
day that great Shakespeare died in Stratford.
The greatest thing England ever did in literature
ended on the day when perhaps the
greatest thing she did in action began. John
Milton said that Cromwell nursed his great
soul in silence and solitude. He was but a
child when the news of the Gunpowder Plot
filled his father's house with excitement. He
was but a child when a dispatch was laid in
his father's hands announcing the death of
Henry of Navarre, the founder of Protestantism
in France. From boyhood he loved the
story of the brave and gallant Sir Walter
Raleigh, and the announcement that he was to
be executed to please the King of Spain filled
him with tumultuous indignation.</p>

<p>In appearance he was above medium stature,
built like Daniel Webster and Brougham
and Beecher, with great, beautiful head,
bronzed face, heavy, projecting eyebrows,
large forehead, two eyes burning like flames
of fire beneath the overhanging cliffs. He was
of sandy complexion, like Alexander and
Napoleon. But if he were thick set, he was
of finely compacted fiber, and this man, who
was to deal a crushing blow at Marston Moor,
and sign the King's death warrant and "grasp
the scepter of a throne" and raze to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
ground the citadels of iniquity, the old strong
castles of feudalism, was also strong enough
to lift little England with her six millions to
a level with the thirty millions of mighty
Spain. Not until he was forty years of age
did this farmer enter Parliament. One day,
in the House of Commons, Sir Philip Warwick,
while listening to a sharp voice, said to John
Hampden, whose seat was near him: "Mr.
Hampden, who is that sloven who spoke just
now, for I see he is on our side, by his speaking
so warmly?" "That sloven," replied
Hampden, "whom you see before you&mdash;that
sloven, I say&mdash;if we ever come to a breach with
the King&mdash;God forbid&mdash;that sloven, I say,
would, in that case, be the greatest man in
England." But Hampden knew him also as
gentle and lovable, tender toward his friends,
loved by his rustic neighbours, though this
vehement man, with sword stuck close to his
side, had stern and uncompromising work, and
the most difficult task ever set before an
Englishman. "A larger soul, I think," writes
Carlyle, "had seldom dwelt in a house of
clay than was his."</p>

<p>Much of the criticism of Cromwell that has
been so bitter, so rabid and so persistent would
at once disappear if it were understood that
the central element in Cromwell's life was religion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
He was first of all a Puritan, essentially
a religious reformer and incidentally a
politician. This is the clue to the maze, this
is the key to the problem, and the solution to
this historical enigma. He was by nature a
poet and a prophet, haunted by sublime vision,
dreaming of heaven and hell, as did
Dante and Bunyan. "Verily," said he, "I
think the Lord is with me. I undertake
strange things, yet do I go through them to
great profit and gladness and furtherance of
the Lord's great work. I do feel myself lifted
on by a strange force. I cannot tell why. By
night and by day I am urged forward in the
great work."</p>

<p>Had he lived in the days of Jeremiah, he
would have dreamed dreams and seen visions
and foretold retribution upon the wrongdoers.
Had he lived in the days of Socrates,
he would have made much of the voice of God.
Had he lived in the time of Bernard the Monk,
or Francis of Assisi, he would have dwelt
apart from men and fed his soul in solitude.
Like John Bunyan, he was a melancholy,
brooding, lonely figure, who sometimes fought
with Apollyon in the Valley of Humiliation,
and sometimes was lifted to the heights of the
Delectable Mountains. He was a man of
singular sincerity, who confessed like Paul:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
"Oft have I been in hell, and sometimes have
I been caught up into the seventh heaven and
heard things not lawful to utter." Blackness
of darkness on one day, blinding radiance
of light on another&mdash;both experiences were
his. "I think I am the poorest wretch that
lives, but I love God, or rather I am beloved
of God." There speaks the religious leader,
and not the ambitious politician.</p>

<p>"In the whole history of Europe," writes
Frederic Harrison, "Oliver Cromwell is the
one ruler into whose presence no vicious man
could ever come, into whose service no vicious
man might ever enter." What an army was
that which he collected! When one of his
officers was guilty of profanity and vulgarity
in his presence, he was immediately dismissed.
Cromwell sought out men like John Milton to
be associated with him in diplomatic work.
"If I were to choose," he writes, "any servant&mdash;the
meanest officers of the army of the Commonwealth&mdash;I
would choose a godly man that
hath principle, especially where a trust is to
be committed, because I know where to find
a man that hath principle." He believed,
also, and practiced prayer, for more things are
wrought by prayer than are dreamed of in
man's philosophy. With Tennyson, he held
that "with prayer men are bound as with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
chains of gold about the feet of God." One
day, overpressed with work, he went into the
country to spend the night with an old friend.
After the Lord Protector had retired, the host
heard words, as of one speaking. Standing
by the door of Cromwell's room, in which he
feared that some enemy might have found entrance,
he heard Cromwell pouring out his
heart to God, telling Him that this was not a
work that he had taken up for himself; that
it was God's work; that the people were God's
children, and the world God's world. Little
wonder that the modern politician cannot
understand Oliver Cromwell, and finds his life
full of contradictory elements.</p>

<p>Not all present-day politicians could stand
the prayer test. Cromwell was a God-intoxicated
man. He believed that the Sermon on
the Mount and the law of Sinai were the basis
of all political creeds. "We think," writes
the historian, "that religion is a part of life;
the Puritan thought it was the whole of life."
That which was morally right could not be
politically wrong, that which was politically
right could not be morally wrong. The principles
of justice and honesty that made the
individual life worthy were one with the
principles that made national life worthy.
Between man and man you expected truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Was it a matter of indifference for the King
to lie to his ministers, his people, and his
Parliament? Is a king to be excused who
broke all pledges, and laid dishonest taxes on
his people? These questions were incidentally
political questions, but primarily moral
problems. And they thrust Cromwell, the
religious recluse, into the whirl and turmoil
of politics, and made him a soldier and a
statesman.</p>

<p>What a study in contrasts is the story of
this farmer of Huntingdon! One day Parliament
makes remonstrance; it sends the King
word that he must call Parliament at regular
intervals; that taxes must be voted by Parliament;
that in the event of the King's refusing
to call a Parliament for the correction of injustice,
the peers may issue the call; that if
the peers refuse, the judges may issue it, and
if the judges play false, the people may come
together for election. Hampden, Pym and
Cromwell indict the King for wrong and
tyranny. Charles gives orders that the five
leaders of Parliament shall be delivered to the
Keeper of the Tower. The King flees to
Hampton Court, and sends the gold plate and
the crown jewels to Paris, hires foreign troops,
lands them upon English shores and England
is plunged into civil war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>For the time being, Parliament is stunned,
and the leaders seem paralyzed. But one
man is equal to the emergency. This farmer,
in rural England, assembles the gentlemen
who live in his neighbourhood. They crowd
under the trees in his orchard, he reads a
psalm, kneels down and prays with them, then
tells them that on the morrow a representative
of the King is to be in Cambridge to call
for troops. Cromwell announces that to-morrow
he proposes to hang the King's representative
at the crossroads, and to seize the
gold plate of the university to hire troops.
"I want no tapsters, or gamesters or cowards,
but only gentlemen who fear God and keep
His commandments." A few weeks later,
Prince Rupert and Charles meet Lord Essex
and the Parliamentary forces at Marston
Moor, and at first are overwhelmingly successful.
When the Puritans are defeated, Lord
Essex orders Cromwell to bring up his regiment,
and the stroke of Cromwell's Ironsides
is the stroke of an earthquake. The farmer
turns defeat into victory.</p>

<p>Then comes the overthrow of Charles at
Naseby, and "God's crowning mercy" at
Worcester. When Scotland tries to force the
Presbytery upon England, Cromwell leads his
troops north to Edinburgh. When the Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
rise up at Drogheda, he marches into Ireland.
When Charles breaks all his pledges, and his
private correspondence is discovered, exhibiting
him in the light of traitor to the liberties
of England, Oliver Cromwell becomes
executioner, for he has to decide between the
head of the King, or the neck of the Parliament.
Offered the throne, with the right of
descent passing over to his son, he refuses the
crown, for he wishes to be the protector, to
guard the precious seeds of liberty until such
time as a worthy successor for the throne shall
appear. If for a time he rules as military
dictator, it grows out of the necessities of the
times, for Parliament is weak, divided into
hostile camps, refusing to correct the laws,
investigate the abuses of judges, revise the
principles of taxation, do anything for the
navy, lighten the burdens of the common
people. Divided into little cliques, Parliament
wastes weeks and months, and at last
Oliver Cromwell enters the House of Commons
and dissolves Parliament, charging them with
having thrown away a great opportunity.
"May God choose between you and me!"
exclaims the one man who understands the
emergency. He is the true king who can do
the thing that needs to be done!</p>

<p>What were the qualities that made Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
the great hero that he was? Lord Morley
tells us that Cromwell was first of all a
practical man, tactful, straightforward, and
going straight to his object. With the instincts
of the true general, for soldiers he
selected sturdy farmers, country gentlemen,
men of iron nerve, who did not drink nor
gamble, but with whom war meant business.
He gave to each of his soldiers a pocket-Bible,
and when he hurled his regiments against the
jaunty and dapper youths who made up the
army of Prince Rupert, his troops swept
through the royalist army "as a cannon ball
goes through a heap of egg-shells." "Pray,
but keep your powder dry," was his motto.
He had also the genius of hard work, and the
love of detail. He could toil terribly. Nothing
escaped his vigilance.</p>

<p>One day he was asked whether he knew that
Charles II, then living in Paris, had a representative
in England? "Certainly," he replied.
"He has one representative who sleeps
in such a house, and another who sleeps near
the palace. The correspondence of the first
is in a trunk under his bed. The letters of the
second are in a certain inn."</p>

<p>When he came at length to live in a palace,
Oliver Cromwell was simple in his tastes, pure
in his morals, tireless in his pursuit of duty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
It is said that he was a Philistine, and the
enemy of culture. But he loved music and
encouraged the opera. He loved literature,
and his warmest friend was John Milton, the
greatest poet and author of the age. If he
levelled the castles of England to the ground,
that feudalism might have no stronghold to
which it could flee, it cannot be said that he
hated art, for Cromwell bought the cartoons
of Raphael for England, and preserved the art
treasures of Charles the First. It stirs our
sense of wonder that men should think that
Cromwell represents opposition to culture,
and that Charles the Second stands for the
refinements of life. Charles the Second, the
royalist, was a king who endeavoured to sell
the cartoons of Raphael that Cromwell had
preserved, to the King of France, to obtain
money for his court. He encouraged bull-baiting
and cock-fighting and pleasures
steeped in animalism and vulgarity. No one
claims that Cromwell himself was a piece of
granite, unhewn and unpolished. The fact
is, neither the Puritan nor the royalist stood
for full culture and refinement. But of the
two men, a thousand times preferable is the
Cromwell who maintained friendship with
John Milton, who represented genius united
to the noblest character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>But great as was Cromwell, the ruler, he
was greater still as father, citizen and Christian.
Alone, amid conspiracies and plots, the
weary Titan staggered on. At last the burden
broke his heart. He held the realm in order
by his will, gave law to Europe, and defended
the weak, crushed the bigot, so that far away
in Rome the Pope trembled at his name, and
the sons of the martyrs blessed him. Suddenly
he realized that his great work was
done. On his death-bed he lay with one hand
upon the breast of Christ, and the other
stretched out toward Washington and Lincoln.
For hours he lay, speaking great and noble
words. The storm that passed over London
that day and uprooted the trees in Hyde Park
was the fitting dirge for the passing of this
noble soul. "God is good," he murmured.
Urged to take a potion and find sleep, he answered:
"It is not my design to drink and
sleep, but my wish is to make what haste I can
to be gone." An hour later he lay calm and
speechless. His work was done. He had
shattered that citadel of iniquity, the Divine
Right of Kings, and secured for the people of
England the rights of conscience and religion.
When the King returned, he returned to reign
in accordance with the people's will. When
the Church was restored, it was restored upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the basis of the Act of Toleration, and the concession
that no church can coerce the conscience
of the people. Cromwell had compacted
Scotland and England. He had outlined
the movement of the reform bill of 1832.
He had brought in an epoch when, for the
first and only time in Europe, morality and
religion were qualifications insisted upon in a
court. Much of that which is best in the life
and thought of America and England, the
republic and the great monarchy alike owe to
that stern workman of God, Oliver Cromwell.</p>

<h2>V<br />
JOHN MILTON<br />
(1608&ndash;1674)</h2>
<h3><i>The Scholar in Politics</i></h3>

<p>By common consent, critics acclaim John
Milton the greatest Latin scholar, the
foremost man of letters and one of the two
first literary artists England has produced.
Historians have united to give him a place
among the ten great names in English history.
Take out of our institutions Milton's plea for
the liberty of the printing press, his views on
education, and all modern society would be
changed. Tennyson called Milton "the God-gifted
organ-voice of England, the mighty-mouthed
inventor of harmonies; an angel
skilled to sing of time and of eternity; a seer
who spent his days and nights listening to the
sevenfold <i>Hallelujah Chorus</i> of Almighty
God." Voltaire was not an Englishman, but
Voltaire characterized Milton's poems as
"the noblest product of the human imagination."
Many American statesmen believe
that the principles of the Compact signed in
the cabin of the <i>Mayflower</i> and the final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Constitution, are none other than the reproduction
in political terms of the dreams of
freedom that haunted the soul of John Milton
all his life long. But it remained for Wordsworth
to pay the supreme tribute to this immortal
singer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy soul was like a star and dwelt apart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst a voice that sounded like the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure as the native heavens, majestic, free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must be free or die that speak the tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Shakespeare spoke; the faith and morals hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Milton held."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Poet, statesman, philosopher, champion and
martyr of English literature, John Milton
was born at one of the critical moments in
the history of mankind. His era, says Macaulay,
"was one of the memorable eras&mdash;the
very crisis of the great conflict between liberty
and despotism, reason and prejudice. The
battle was fought for no single generation, for
no single land. The destinies of the human
race were staked on the same cast with the
freedom of the English people. Then were
first proclaimed those mighty principles which
have since worked their way into the depth
of the American forests . . . and from
one end of Europe to the other have kindled
an unquenchable fire in the hearts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
oppressed. Of those principles, then struggling
for their existence, Milton was the most
devoted and eloquent champion."</p>

<p>If it be true, as Macaulay would have us
believe, that as civilization advances, poetry
necessarily declines, and that in an enlightened
and literary society the poet's difficulties
are "in proportion to his proficiency" as a
scholar, then it may truly be said that few
poets have triumphed over greater difficulties
than John Milton. He was born at the end of
the heroic age in English literature, and he
enjoyed all the benefits and advantages that
travel and culture could bestow upon him.
If, however, as others of us believe, great literature
is like a spring of clear water, bubbling
out of the soil, and no man can say
what mysterious elements give it its crystal
purity, then it behooves us to examine somewhat
into the nature of Milton's parentage,
the character of his environment and the significance
of the training he received as a
young man.</p>

<p>The great poet was born in London, eight
years before the death of Shakespeare. The
first sixteen years of his life were the last sixteen
of the reign of James I. In Cheapside,
within a block of his father's house, stood the
old "Mermaid" tavern of Marlow, Ben Jonson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Dekker and Philip Massinger. His father
was a scrivener, who drew deeds, made wills,
invested money for his clients, and, in general,
fulfilled for many families the tasks that
now devolve upon the modern trust company.
The father's skill and probity won for him an
increasing number of clients, and with money
came leisure for study and travel. He was a
musician, a man of culture, a composer of
considerable note; and he made his home an
all-round center for young artists and authors.
From the beginning, he recognized the unique
genius of his son, and made the development
of that genius to be the chief object of his life.
He never tired of telling the boy that his first
duty was to make the most possible out of himself.
He held to those ideals that were outlined
in Plato's and Aristotle's books on education.
Whatever development could come
through music, art, lectures, books, teachers,
travel, was given the young poet. Just as
misers pursue the accumulation of gold, just
as ambitious statesmen pursue office and
honour, so this father, by day and by night,
toiled upon the education of his son; first
teaching the child in his own library; then
calling to his aid wise and experienced tutors;
then sending the boy to a great London grammar
school and thence to Cambridge University.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
The boy showed promise from the
first. His exercises, "in English or other
tongue, prosing or versing, but chiefly the
latter," early attracted attention. He studied
hard, at school and at home; often studying
till twelve at night. He loved books, "and
he loved better to be foremost." He was only
fifteen years of age when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let us blaze his name abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of gods, he is the God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who by wisdom did create<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' painted heavens so full of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He the golden tress&egrave;d sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caused all day his course to run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th' horn&egrave;d moon to hang by night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid her spangled sisters bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&nbsp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his mercies aye endure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever faithful, ever sure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Throughout his youth, Milton's enthusiasm
for reading and learning burned like a fire, by
day and by night. He was one of the few
students outside of Italy who could think in
Latin, debate in Latin, and write verse in
Latin quite as readily as in English. "He was
a profound and elegant classical scholar; he
had studied all the mysteries of Rabbinical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
literature; he was intimately acquainted with
every language of modern Europe from which
either pleasure or information was then to be
derived." He fulfilled his own definition of
education:&mdash;"I call a complete and generous
education that which fits a man to perform
justly, skillfully and magnanimously all the
offices, both private and public, of peace and
war." And he believed that culture and
character should have an aggressive note.
"I take it to be my portion in this life, by
labour and intense study, to leave something
so written to after time, that they should
not willingly let it die." Faithfully did he
seek to live up to these high ideals. He
sowed no wild oats, cut no bloody gashes in
his conscience and memory, dwelt apart from
vice and sensualism, and, at last, left the
university with the approbation of the good
and with no stain upon his soul.</p>

<p>Upon entering Cambridge it had been his
intention to become a clergyman, but that intention
he soon abandoned. The reasons he
gives us are "the tyranny that had invaded
the church," and the fact that, finding he
could not honestly subscribe to the oaths and
obligations required, he "thought it better to
preserve a blameless silence before the sacred
office of speaking, begun with servitude and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
forswearing." His father, meantime, had retired
from business, and taken a country
house in a small village near Windsor, about
twenty miles from London. Few fathers have
ever been as generous in meeting and encouraging
a son's desire to devote himself to literature.
For the next five years and eight
months, in that country quietude, within sight
of the towers of Windsor, Milton describes
himself as "wholly intent, through a period
of absolute leisure, on a steady perusal of the
Greek and Latin writers." His father, of
course, had provided the funds. His biographer
Masson says: "Not until Milton was
thirty-two years of age, if even then, did he
earn a penny for himself." Such a life would
have ruined ninety-nine out of every hundred
talented young men; but it is the genius of
Milton that he put those years to good use.
Believing himself to be one dedicated to a high
purpose, he not only completed his studies in
classical literature but produced, at the same
time, those early immortal classics known as
his "minor" poems. There he wrote the
"Lycidas," one of the world's great elegies;
there the "Comus," which alone of all the
masques of that time and preceding time, "has
gone in its entirety into the body of living
English literature." And there he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
those two exquisite, airy fancies known to
every schoolboy under the titles of "L'Allegro,"
and "Il Penseroso."</p>

<p>It was in 1638, at the age of thirty, that
Milton determined to broaden his views by
study in foreign lands. Once more his father
generously made possible the fulfillment of
his ambition. The young scholar naturally
turned his steps toward Italy, then the home
of painting, letters and the newer learning.
His biographer pictures him for us&mdash;"a slight,
patrician figure, distinguished alike in mind
and physique. . . . He carries letters from
Sir Henry Wotton; he sees the great Hugo
Grotius at Paris; sees the sunny country of
olives in Provence; sees the superb front of
Genoa piling up from the blue waters of the
Mediterranean; sees Galileo at Florence&mdash;the
old philosopher too blind to study the face of
the studious young Englishman that has come
so far to greet him. He sees, too, what is best
and bravest at Rome; among the rest St.
Peter's, just then brought to completion, and
in the first freshness of its great tufa masonry.
He is f&ecirc;ted by studious young Italians; has
the freedom of the Accademia della Crusca;
blazes out in love-sonnets to some dark-eyed
signorina of Bologna; returns by Venice and
by Geneva where he hobnobs with the Diodati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
friends of his old school-fellow, Charles
Diodati." In Rome again, we find him writing
Latin poems, some of which, seen by
learned Italians, stir these writers to amazement
at the thought that a Briton could be so
excellent a Latin poet. It was their praise,
Milton says in one of his letters, that led to
his renewed resolve to devote his life to literature.
Then and there he determined to do for
England what Homer had done for Greece,
what Virgil had done for Rome, what Dante
had done for Italy. Lingering in the Sistine
Chapel and in the various galleries of the
Vatican, he saw the religious dramas of
Michael Angelo, and the paintings of Raphael,
with the story of the temptation of Adam and
Eve, culminating in the Last Judgment. And
in those hours of leisure and contemplation he
stored his memory with the glorious images
that he was to use in later years for unfolding
and unveiling the fall of man's soul in his
<i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>Paradise Regained</i>.</p>

<p>It was while he was in the midst of his
studies in the libraries of Rome and Florence,
that the news reached him of the civil war
threatening at home. Charles the First had
reaffirmed the doctrine of the divine right of
kings&mdash;that iniquitous theory which long
afterward was to be revived by Kaiser Wilhelm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
as an excuse for the Great War. Over
against Charles stood the Parliament, representing
the people, and led by John Eliot and
John Pym, John Hampden and Oliver Cromwell.
Milton, with instant decision, turned his
steps toward England. "I thought it dishonourable,"
he tells us, "that I should be
travelling at ease for amusement when my
fellow-countrymen at home were fighting for
liberty." Back in London, he found the country
rocking on a red wave&mdash;the Scotch marching
over the border&mdash;the Long Parliament
portending&mdash;Strafford and Laud on the verge
of impeachment&mdash;city pitted against city;
brother against brother. His own father,
drawing near to the end of his life, was a
strong Royalist. The storm had broken, and
in that sea of trouble the King and the old
leaders were to go down. It is the glory of
Milton that in that hour he chose to ally himself
with a great cause and abandoning, for the
time, his dream of an immortal epic, threw
himself into the struggle for intellectual and
moral liberty.</p>

<p>For the next twenty years, he was engulfed
in a maelstrom of politics, tossed on a feverish
tide of political hatred. With his own father
and brother on the side of the King, he could
no longer live under their roof; and unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
to surrender his convictions of freedom and
self-government, he struck out for himself in
London. He took lodgings, and for years
earned a slender livelihood by preparing
pupils for the university. He gave his mornings
to his students, and spent his evenings in
writing pleas, attacking the autocracy of the
King, and supporting the Puritan Leaders
who wished to found the new commonwealth.
It was not only Milton's life that was so
affected. The lives of almost all his English
contemporaries suffered similarly. Through
the twenty years, from 1640 to 1660, there was
an eclipse of pure literature in England.
When he wrote he wrote necessarily, in prose.
"I have the use," he explains, "as I may
account it, of my <i>left hand</i>." But never once
did he lose sight of his ideal&mdash;poetry.
"Neither do I think it shame," he explains in
one of his pamphlets, "to covenant with any
knowing reader, that for some few years yet I
may go on trust with him toward the payment
of what I am now indebted,"&mdash;meaning the
composition of some poem which "the world
would not willingly let die." He kept his
promise&mdash;in the fullness of time. But in the
interval, he played his part in the great drama
of the Civil War.</p>

<p>At the very outset he was forced to endure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and triumph over a personal misfortune. Like
Shakespeare and Goethe, and many other
poets, John Milton was most unfortunate in
his marital life. At thirty-five, after a month's
rest in the country, he returned to London,
bringing with him a wife. She was young
and of a family virtually committed to the
Royalist cause; she had a shallow mind, and
no sympathy either for Milton's artistic aims
or his political convictions. The Civil War
was on, Milton was giving himself with intense
application to important public topics, was
away from home in consultation with public
men the long day through, and often returned
late at night. The poor girl was in despair.
A stranger in a great city, with no gift for
friendship, she slowly became conscious of the
fact that she never could be interested in John
Milton's life. Urging the necessity of a brief
visit to her country home, she went away and
later positively refused to return. Milton was
first hurt, then angered and finally disillusioned;
and after great mental distress and
careful study of the whole question of marriage
and divorce, he published his views,
which have exerted a profound and lasting
influence upon society.</p>

<p>John Milton held that divorce should be as
easy as marriage, and that when two people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
beginning their contract in good faith, discover
after honest endeavour, that there can
be no happiness in the home, and both decide
that it is best and honourable to separate, then
there should be no legal obstacle to prevent
this, providing always that proper provision
be made for the support and education of
children, whose character and disposition
could not fail to be injured by the daily
spectacle of unhappiness. Years afterward,
when his wife's family had been rendered
homeless, he took them all back into his own
house. When his wife died, he married again,
and within a year he was left a widower. Six
years later he married his third wife, but his
home was embittered by endless warfare between
his daughters and his third wife. One
of his letters says plainly that his wife was
kind to him in his blind, old age when his
daughters were undutiful and inhuman.</p>

<p>The Civil War was scarcely begun before
he issued the first of those thunderbolts of
indignation and exhortation known as his
pamphlets on church discipline, education, and
the liberty of unlicensed printing. The years
that followed were years of incessant labour.
He began and completed during this period
his <i>History of England</i>, written from the viewpoint
of the common people and tracing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ills, the poverty, and rebellion of Britain to
misgovernment and tyranny. When Parliament
tried the King upon charges of treason,
and executed Charles, it was John Milton who

JOHN MILTON.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Milton was not only the greatest pamphleteer
of his generation&mdash;"head and shoulders
above the rest"&mdash;but there is no life of that
time, not even Cromwell's, in which the history
of the revolution, so far as the deep
underlying ideas were concerned, may be better
studied. He was the first Englishman of
note outside of Parliament to attach himself
thus openly to the new Commonwealth. And
every one of his prose works had this great
quality, that it struck a blow for liberty.</p>

<p>In beginning any study of Milton it must
be remembered that his intellect was essentially
athletic. If he was the great poet of his
era, he was not a dreamer of the closet, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
man who plunged into the thick of the fight,
and made his writing and his doing a vital and
indestructible part of his time. In analyzing
the scholar's influence, De Quincey speaks of
"the literature of knowledge" and "the literature
of power." The function of the first is
to teach men, the function of the second is to
move and persuade men to action. De Quincey
wishes us to understand that Milton's writings
entered almost immediately into the thinking
and the doing of the British people, just as
bread enters into the blood of the physical
system. Milton cared nothing for learning for
its own sake. Knowledge was important only
to the degree in which it was vitally creative,
inspiring men, correcting their blunders, rebuking
their selfishness, enlightening their
darkness, and lifting them into the realm of
silence, peace, and mystery. After defining
the true scholar and Christian, as a knight
going forth to war against every form of
ignorance and tyranny, he exclaims, "I cannot
praise a fugitive and cloistered virtue unexercised
and unbreathed, that never sallies
out and sees her adversary, but slinks out of
the race, where that immortal garland is to
be run for, not without dust and heat."
Learning, with Milton, was a means of enlarging
his being and doing. Mark Pattison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
has well said, "He cultivated not letters, but
himself, and sought to enter into possession of
his own mental kingdom. Not that he might
reign there, but that he might royally use its
resources in building up a work which should
bring honour to his country and his native
tongue."</p>

<p>The glory of the battle which he fought for
freedom&mdash;the freedom of the human mind&mdash;is
all his own. "Thousands and tens of thousands
among his contemporaries raised their
voices against ship-money and the Star
Chamber; but there were few indeed who discerned
the more fearful evils of moral and
intellectual slavery, and the benefits which
would result from the liberty of the press and
the unfettered exercise of private judgment."
Milton was determined that the people should
think for themselves, as well as tax themselves.
And that he might shake the very foundations
of the corruptions which he saw debasing the
state, he selected for himself the most arduous
and dangerous literary service. "At the beginning
he wrote with incomparable energy
and eloquence against the bishops. But, when
his opinion seemed likely to prevail, he passed
on to other subjects, and abandoned prelacy
to the crowd of writers who now hastened to
insult a falling party." He pressed always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
into the forlorn hope. The very men who
most disapproved of his opinions were forced
to respect the hardihood with which he maintained
them.</p>

<p>Milton's prose pamphlets deserve the close
study of every writer who wishes to know
the full power of the English language. They
sparkle with fine passages; they ring with
eloquence; they have the fire and the fervour
of a great mind at white heat. For quotable
sentences, they are "a perfect field of cloth
of gold." And the fineness and stiffness of
their texture is by no means their greatest
splendour. Every one of these controversial
pamphlets answers to its author's definition of
a good book in that it contains "the precious
life-blood of a master spirit."</p>

<p>By far the most popular, and probably the
most eloquent of all his prose writings is the
famous <i>Areopagitica</i>, his argument for the
liberty of unlicensed printing. It appeared
on the 25th of November 1664, deliberately
unlicensed and unregistered, and was a remonstrance
addressed to Parliament in the
form and style of an oration to be delivered
in the assembly. Nobly eulogistic of Parliament
in other respects, it denounced their
printing ordinance as utterly unworthy of
them, and of the new era of English liberties.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Admired to-day because its main doctrine has
become axiomatic&mdash;at one blow it accomplished
the repeal of the licensing system and
established forever the freedom of the English
press&mdash;it contains passages which for power
and beauty of prose make the finest declamations
of Edmund Burke sink into insignificance.</p>

<p>It was not, however, the <i>Areopagitica</i>, but
his vindication of the execution of Charles the
First that procured for Milton the office of
Latin Secretary under Cromwell's government.
His boundless admiration for Cromwell
had shown itself already in his immortal
sonnet on the great soldier. He considered
Cromwell the greatest and the best man of his
generation, or of many generations; and he
regarded Cromwell's assumption of the supreme
power, as well as his retention of that
power with a sovereign title, "as no real suppression
of the republic, but as necessary for
the preservation of the republic." Cromwell,
in turn, saw in Milton a most powerful defender
of the new commonwealth. By 1651
it was generally conceded that "the reputation
of the Commonwealth abroad had been
established by two agencies, and only two:&mdash;the
victories of Cromwell, and the prose
pamphlets of John Milton." In the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the case, their friendship and mutual respect
of the two men was inevitable.</p>

<p>After the death of Charles, new treaties had
to be drawn between England and Spain,
England and France and Italy and Holland.
These state papers were all written in Latin,
and the Secretary of Latin and of Foreign
Relations was a great person in the cabinet
of every country. Milton's knowledge of
Spanish, French, Italian, German, Dutch, as
well as Latin and Greek, made him an important
figure in the deliberations of Cromwell's
Council of State. His special duty was the
drafting in Latin of letters of state, but from
the first, he was employed in every conceivable
kind of work. The council looked to him for
everything in the nature of literary vigilance
in the interests of the struggling Commonwealth.
He was employed in personal conferences,
in the examination of suspected
papers, in interviews with their authors and
printers, agents of foreign towns, envoys,
ambassadors. It was a period of intense and
feverish activity, with cabinet meetings, conferences
between the leaders of the government,
necessarily held at night. In that era
of candle-light and flickering torches, with oil
and electricity both still unknown, Milton,
with despatches to be translated, notes to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
made at all hours, was soon imperilling his
eyesight. He was forty years of age when he
took the post; at forty-six, as a result of his
continuous and indomitable activities, he had
ruined his eyes and was totally blind.</p>

<p>Wonderful the fortitude with which he
faced this affliction! Hear the lines he composed
in the first of those dark days:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When I consider how my light is spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that one talent, which is death to hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve therewith my Maker, and present<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My true account, lest he, returning, chide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Dost God exact day-labour, light denied?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fondly ask: But Patience, to prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That murmur, soon replies&mdash;'God doth not heed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either man's work, or his own gifts; who best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best; his state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And post o'er land and ocean without rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They also serve, who only stand and wait.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And hard upon this catastrophe came a
new turn in the wheel of fortune. Cromwell
died; the Commonwealth came to an end; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
London threw its cap in the air at the Restoration.
The leaders of the Commonwealth had
to flee for their lives. Some fled to America
for safety and some were caught and executed.
Cromwell's body was taken from its grave in
Westminster Abbey, suspended from the
gallows, and left to dangle there. Past Milton's
house, near Red Lion Square, the howling
mob went by, dragging the body of his
old leader. Milton himself, blind and in hiding,
narrowly escaped execution. His head
was forfeit, his pamphlets burned by public
order. Only chance, and the exertion of influential
friends, saved him from discovery
and death. His escape from the scaffold is a
mystery now, as it was a mystery at the
time.</p>

<p>In the evil days that followed&mdash;the days of
the Restoration, with its revenges and reactions,
its return to high Episcopacy and suppression
of every form of dissent and sectarianism,
its new and shameless royal court&mdash;Milton,
blind and forgotten by the public,
turned to his long-cherished dream of a great
poem. For twenty years, through all the
storm and stress of political agitation, it had
never been banished wholly from his thoughts.
In the library of Cambridge University there
may be seen to-day a list of over one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
possible subjects, written in his own hand during
some leisure-hour when he was pondering
the great project of his heart. Living in retirement,
visited only by a few close friends,
he now proceeded to compose the masterpiece
planned as a young man. Unable to see a
book, forced to beg every friend who visited
him to read aloud to him, dependent upon the
assistance of three rebellious daughters, none
of whom understood the many languages he
knew so well, he nevertheless drove forward,
determined to finish his task. <i>Paradise Lost</i>,
begun and brought to completion in the face
of every sort of discouragement, was finished
in 1665 and published in 1667.</p>

<p>This amazing poem&mdash;the glory of English
literature&mdash;is one of the few monumental
works of the world. The English language
possesses no other epic poem, nor a poem of
any other kind, which approaches it in sustained
sublimity. Nothing in modern epic
literature is comparable to it save only the
<i>Divine Comedy</i> of Dante. It is impossible, in
a single page or chapter, to call the roll of the
beauties of Milton's poetic style. Much has
been written of the organ-music of his verse,
its magical, mysterious influence. Speaking
generally, the terms mean little; but applied
to Milton, both have significance. For his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
melody, his verse-structure, the very names he
employs act like an incantation, with an
almost occult power.</p>

<p>James Russell Lowell emphasizes this
quality: "It is wonderful how, from the most
withered and juiceless hint gathered in his
reading, his grand images rise like an exhalation;
how from the most battered old lamp,
caught in that huge drag-net with which he
swept the waters of learning, he could conjure
up a tall genii to build his palaces."
His words, says Macaulay, in another brilliant
summary, "are words of enchantment. No
sooner are they pronounced, than the past
is present and the distant near. New forms
of beauty start at once into existence, and all
the burial places of the memory give up their
dead. Change the structure of the sentence;
substitute one synonym for another, and the
whole effect is destroyed. There is large
learning in the poem&mdash;weighty and recondite;
but this spoils no music; great cumbrous
names catch sonorous vibrations under his
modulating touch, and colossal shields and
spheres clash together like symbols. The
whole burden of his knowledges&mdash;Pagan,
Christian, or Hebraic, lift up and sink away
upon the undulations of his sublime verse, as
heavy-laden ships rise and fall upon some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
great ground swell making in from outer
seas."</p>

<p>Fully to comprehend the peculiar sublimity
of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, one must understand the
peculiar character of the age in which Milton
was living. It was a theological era, as the
next century was a political era. In their
reaction from the absolutism of Rome, the
Puritans hated everything that reminded
them of the Roman excesses, and that revulsion
extended not only to the ecclesiastical
autocracy of Rome, but to the lesser things,
the clouds of incense, stained glass and the
rich dresses of the clergy, the ecclesiastical
holidays. These Puritans are called by Macaulay
the most remarkable body of men that
the world has ever produced. They had a
contempt for all terrestrial distinctions. Confident
of the favour of God, they despised the
dignities of this world. "Unacquainted with
the works of philosophers and poets they were
deeply read in the oracles of God. If their
names were not found in the registers of
heralds, they were recorded in the Book of
Life. If their steps were not accompanied by
a splendid train of menials, legions of ministering
angels had charge over them. Their
palaces were houses not made with hands;
their diadems crowns of glory which shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
never fade away. On the rich and the eloquent,
on nobles and priests they looked down
with contempt; for they esteemed themselves
rich in a more precious treasure, and eloquent
in a more sublime language, nobles by right
of an earlier creation and priests by the imposition
of a mightier hand. Thus the Puritan
was made up of two different men&mdash;the
one all self-abasement, penitence, gratitude,
passion; the other proud, calm, inflexible,
sagacious. He prostrated himself in the dust
before his Maker; but he set his foot on the
neck of his King."</p>

<p>It is only to be expected that the literature
of such an age&mdash;both prose and poetry&mdash;should
be to a large degree theological. Milton's
<i>Paradise Lost</i> is an epic of war between
good and evil. Not that, strictly speaking,
Milton belonged to the class just described.
He was not a Puritan, any more than he was
a Freethinker, or a Royalist. In his character
the noblest qualities of all three groups were
combined. "From the Parliament and from
the Court, from the conventicle and from the
Gothic cloister, from the gloomy circles of the
Roundheads and the Christmas revels of the
Cavalier, his nature selected and drew to itself
whatever was great and good." But the
peculiar religious note that is in his great epic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the serious note, the note of dignity, is the
distillation of an atmosphere charged and
aquiver with the most intense theological convictions.</p>

<p>Numerous accounts have come down to us
of Milton's personal appearance and habits
toward the end of his life. By nature a
patrician, reserved, clothed with a gentle dignity,
he was not without a certain haughty,
defiant self-assertion such as Lowell ascribes
to Dante and Michael Angelo. He came to be
a familiar figure in the neighbourhood of his
residence, "a slender figure, of middle stature
or a little less, generally dressed in a grey
cloak or overcoat, and wearing sometimes a
small silver-hilted sword, evidently in feeble
health, but still looking younger than he was,
with his lightish hair, and his fair, rather
than aged or pale, complexion."</p>

<p>He was a very early riser, and regular in
the distribution of his day, "spending the first
part, to his midday dinner, always in his own
room, amid his books, with an amanuensis to
read for him and write to his dictation.
Usually there was singing in the late afternoon,
when there was a voice to sing for him;
and instrumental music, when his, or a
friendly hand touched the old organ." He
loved the out-of-door life, walked much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
fields, loved his garden and his flowers, made
his library to be the world of the open air.</p>

<p>From time to time learned and noble visitors,
native and foreign, made their way to his
modest home. They read in the lines of his
noble countenance the proud and mournful
history of his glory and his affliction. They
listened to his slightest words, they kneeled to
kiss his hand and weep upon it, for the
neglect of an age that was unworthy of his
talents and his virtues. They contested with
his daughters the privilege of reading Homer
to him, or of taking down the immortal accents
which flowed from his lips. But, for
the most part, his last days were days of retirement.
The grand loneliness of his latter
years makes him the most impressive figure
in our literary history. Yet it is idle to talk
of the loneliness of one, the habitual companions
of whose mind were the Past and
Future. "I always seem to see him, leaning
in his blindness, one hand on the shoulder of
each, sure that the Future will guard the
song which the Past had inspired."</p>

<p>Few characters have stood the test of time
and history so well. And no other man has
so fully incarnated himself in literature.
Therefore the tribute of James Russell Lowell:
"We say of Shakespeare that he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
power of transforming himself into everything,
but of Milton that he had the power
of transforming everything into himself."
Dante is individual, rather than self-conscious,
and he, the cast-iron man, grows
pliable as a field of grain at the breath of
Beatrice, and flows away in waves of sunshine.
But Milton never let himself go for a
moment. As other poets are possessed by
their theme, so is he self-possessed, his great
theme being John Milton, and his great duty
that of interpreter between him and the
world. Puritanism has left an abiding mark
in politics and religion, but its true monuments
are the prose of Bunyan and the verse
of Milton. For the epitaph written by his
friend was scrupulously accurate: "Whatsoever
things are true, whatsoever things are
pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever
things are honest, whatsoever things are
of good report, Milton thought upon these
things."</p>

<h2>VI<br />
JOHN WESLEY<br />
(1703&ndash;1791)</h2>
<h3><i>And the Moral Awakening of the Common<br />
People</i></h3>

<p>Now that long time has passed, the two
bright names of the eighteenth century
are seen to be the names of Washington
and Wesley. The statement will come with a
note of shock to many readers, but beyond
most critical estimates, it is one that will
stand examination. Time has a way of reversing
judgments, and not the least of the
changes in men's thought has been the gradual
transformation in the attitude of the historian
toward Wesley, carried to his grave by six
poor men in 1791. Now that one hundred
and twenty years have passed, Wesley has
thirty millions of followers, who believe in his
method and are carrying forward his work.
The time has come when there is not a city
in Great Britain, or on the North American
continent, or in India&mdash;and few indeed, of any
size in China or Japan&mdash;where there are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
some disciples of this teacher, spreading his
message, according to his plan. During these
hundred and twenty years, dynasties have
fallen, empires have perished, cities and states
have changed, but the ideas and the influence
of Wesley, stamped upon the memories of his
followers, have spread like leaven, working
often in silence and secrecy, but slowly transforming
the world.</p>

<p>The praise of his critics is enough to lend
John Wesley enduring fame. Leslie Stephen
called him "the greatest captain of men of
his century." Macaulay ridiculed the historians
of his day who failed to see that "the
greatest event of the era was the work of
Wesley." To Macaulay's statement that
Wesley had a genius for government, equal
to that of Richelieu, Matthew Arnold added,
"He had a genius for godliness." Buckle
called him the first of ecclesiastical statesmen,
while Lecky said, "Wesley's sermons were of
greater historic importance to England than
all the victories by land and sea under Pitt."</p>

<p>"No other man," writes Augustine Birrell,
"did such a life-work for England. He
helped to save England from the horrors of
the French Revolution." This is not a careless
pronouncement, nor an instance of biographical
exaggeration. Born in 1703, belonging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
to the era just preceding the French
Revolution, John Wesley, with his fifty years
among the working people of Great Britain,
changed the thinking of his time. The eighteenth
century was a coarse age; Carlyle summarized
it in a single biting phrase: "soul
extinct; stomach well alive." The pictures of
Hogarth, the journals of Wesley, and the
<i>History of Great Criminals</i> prove that there
was at least a basis for Carlyle's bitterness.
Dr. Johnson, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, defines a pension
as "pay given to a street hireling for
treason to his country." Burke describes the
British Secretary of State as "the greatest
drunkard and most unlucky gambler of his
age." Walpole portrays cabinet ministers
and statesmen reeling into the ferry-boat of
Charon at forty-five, worn out with drunkenness
and gout. In his pictures of Beer Street
and Gin Lane, Hogarth sketches the drunkenness
and filth of the London that he calls "the
city of gallows," with a street that was a lane
of gibbets, where the corpses of felons hung.
Hume and Walpole both prophesied an inevitable
revolution, with corpses that would be
piled up as barricades "in front of human
beasts who fought with the ferocity of
tigers." But at the very moment when
France was seething with revolt, across in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
England, in Newcastle and Moorfields, thousands
of grimy miners were assembled, now
weeping in penitence, now singing hymns of
praise to God. When the spirit of destruction
swept over Europe, Wesley's revival had
done its work, and its influence held the
people of England back from the horrors of
the guillotine in Paris. It is for this reason
that historians rank John Wesley in terms of
abiding influence, above Pitt, Wellington and
Nelson.</p>

<p>In <i>Adam Bede</i>, George Eliot, the great
novelist, describes with the minuteness of
an eye-witness an open-air revival meeting
among the early Methodists of England. Her
heroine, Dinah Morris, relates the incident in
the following words: "It was on just such a
sort of evening as this, when I was a little
girl, and my aunt took me to hear a good man
preach out-of-doors, just as we are here. I
remember his face well; he was a very old
man, and had very long, white hair, his voice
was very soft and beautiful, not like any voice
I had ever heard before. I was a little girl,
and scarcely knew anything, and this old man
seemed to me such a different sort of man
from anybody I had ever seen before, that I
thought that he had perhaps come down from
the skies to preach to us, and I said, 'Aunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
will he go back into the sky to-night, like the
picture in the Bible?'" . . . That man of
God was John Wesley, who had spent a lifetime
going up and down the land, doing good.
He had preached from fifteen to twenty times
a week for fifty years&mdash;in all, over forty
thousand times. In this, his sixty-second year,
he was to preach eight hundred times. He
had ridden nearly two hundred and fifty
thousand miles; and in his long preaching
tours through Ireland he had crossed the
Channel forty times. The poor had lost their
heart to him. The ignorant, the outcast, the
collier and clerk alike, all pressed and
thronged about this saintly figure, with his
beautiful face, his clear eyes, his musical voice,
who never tired of telling people, "God is
love; Christ is love; and religion is life, as it
is the happiest, so it is the cheerfullest thing
in the world."</p>

<p>It is written of Moses that his hands were
held up by two friends, Aaron and Hur. Not
otherwise John Wesley was supported on
either side by two great comrades,&mdash;Whitefield,
the evangelist, and his own brother,
Charles Wesley. If any man ever had the
gift of eloquence and oratory, it was George
Whitefield. At twenty-one years of age
Whitefield received orders, and within a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
year he was England's first preacher in point
of hearers. His warmest friends may have
overpraised this evangelist, but his harshest
critics concede that he had the most musical,
carrying voice that ever issued from a speaker's
throat. During his career he wrote some
sixty sermons, but he preached them over and
over again, eighteen thousand times. Within
a single week he spoke on an average of forty
hours. There is nothing in his sermons, as
they have come down to us, to explain their
marvellous transforming influence, but Whitefield
had the vision of the seer, saw heaven and
hell as clearly as he saw the world around him,
and could make men see and feel what he
himself experienced. Benjamin Franklin
heard Whitefield preach in Philadelphia, and
was carried away by the personality of the
preacher, whose luminous eyes, matchless
voice, and transfigured face stirred the men
of the Quaker City as if he were the angel
Gabriel.</p>

<p>Charles Wesley, like George Whitefield, was
an evangelist who preached constantly in the
open air, to multitudes of fifteen to twenty
thousand people. He was without the iron
strength of Whitefield, but for fifteen years he
did preach once a day, and sometimes two and
three times. He lacked Whitefield's organ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
voice, and the strange mystic, magical charm
of his brother John, but his sentences were
short, with the swiftness of bullets, and he was
a most persuasive orator. The fact was,
Charles Wesley's emotions were often beyond
his powers of control. He pled with men with
tears running down his cheeks; his voice shook
and quavered; he melted men until their
hearts were like water. Often, in the midst of
his sermon, he broke into song. In theory he
was a high-churchman, but in practice he was
a nonconformist, who ordained laymen to the
ministry. He was a little man, short-sighted,
quick to resent a wrong, loyal in friendship,
most lovable, full of faults, and full of sorrow
by reason of his faults, an inspired singer of
hymns; but he lacked the order, the organizing
gift, the iron purpose and the unyielding will
of his brother John.</p>

<p>Far greater than either Whitefield or
Charles Wesley was the brother, preacher,
statesman, theologian, scholar, and evangelist.
John Wesley outlived Whitefield by thirty,
and his brother Charles, by four years. If
Whitefield preached eighteen thousand times,
this amazing man preached forty-two thousand,
four hundred times and within fifty-one
years. His comrades broke down, his
friends passed away, bitter opposition developed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the doors of the churches were closed
against him but Wesley's zeal "burned
long, burned undimmed, burned when even
the fire of life turned to ashes." For fifty
years he not only preached, but published
seven volumes a year. He did an enormous
work as author and publisher. In the interests
of the poor he was the first man to
publish cheap literature, and he brought many
wise books within the reach of colliers and
peasants. He wrote a volume on household
medicine; simple books on grammar, style,
good health and history. He translated the
writings of other authors, and abridged works
that were beyond the poor man's purse. The
germ of the modern lecture system, social
settlement work, night-schools, and the shelter-houses
of General Booth, are all in Wesley's
work. He accomplished an incredible amount
as author, publisher, educator, and organizer
of social and political reforms. His <i>Journal</i>,
covering a period of fifty-four years, and
existing to-day in the shape of twenty-one
beautifully written volumes, has been called
"the most amazing record of human exertion
ever penned."</p>

<p>This personal <i>Journal</i> of John Wesley deserves
a place among the few great journals
of the world. There are only two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
eighteen century volumes worthy to be spoken
of in the same breath:&mdash;Walpole's <i>Letters</i>
and Boswell's <i>Johnson</i>. Horace Walpole
was the rich idler, the male butterfly, who
lived for pleasure and position, and in his
gossiping letters embalmed for later generations
"all the lords and ladies, the rakes and
flirts, the fools and spendthrifts, the gossip
and scandal of a rich man's career." Dr.
Johnson stands for manliness, independence,
courage, robust common sense. His chief interests
in life were literature and politics, and
Boswell says that he divided society into two
classes, Whigs who were to be cudgelled and
scourged, and Tories who were to be admired
and praised. But Wesley's <i>Journal</i> is upon a
far higher level. His spirit is not that of
curiosity, as was Walpole's, nor of vehement
resentment and personal preferences, as was
Johnson's. It is that of a passionate and divine
pity. He possessed an overpowering sense
of the value of men apart from their position,
their politics, their knowledge or ignorance,
their poverty or wealth; he saw them as God
sees them. And the result is a work far
sweeter and finer than either of the two
famous volumes just considered.</p>

<p>Wonderful the picture of serenity and
strength given us in these intimate, vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
pages. The story of a single day is the story
of the whole fifty years. Wesley rose at four
o'clock, read his devotional books until five,
preached in the open air to the colliers who
had to go to their tasks at half-past six.
After breakfast at seven, he mounted his
horse; drew rein for a few minutes from
time to time to read a page in some book that
he was analyzing; after twenty or thirty
miles' ride, preached in a public square or
some churchyard at noon; dismissed his hearers
at one o'clock that they might return to
their work; rode rapidly, often twenty miles,
to his next appointment, where he preached
at five; after supper, when the evening twilight
fell, preached again, holding a service
that often lasted until nine or even ten
o'clock.</p>

<p>During the half century, Wesley worked
along the lines of a triangle, westward
from London to Bristol, north by Liverpool
and Carlisle to Newcastle; then back to
London through the towns of the east coast
of England. His preaching tours followed
the lines of England's industrial centers. He
worked where the population was thickest.
He loved the mining districts, where two or
three thousand men would assemble for him
at almost any hour of the day. The falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
rain never disturbed him, the rough roads
seemed to bring no tire. He loved crowds,
and noise and excitement did not seem to
wear upon his strength. Apparently there
was not a tired or sore nerve in his wonderful
little body. An entry in his journal speaks
of having travelled that day ninety miles, and
not being in the least tired, although he seems
to have preached three times. "Many a
rough journey have I had before," says the
<i>Journal</i>, "but one like this I never had, between
wind and rain, ice and snow, and driving
sleet and piercing cold. But it is past;
those days will return no more, and are therefore
as though they had never been." His
appointments were often made a fortnight in
advance. His journals are filled with pictures
of deep snow, dripping skies, bitter northwest
winds.</p>

<p>What is the secret of Wesley's greatness,
and how did he ever endure such labour? The
hidings of his power are in his wonderful
ancestry. Long after Samuel Wesley's death,
the son found in the garret of the old rectory
a manuscript of his father's, with a scheme of
world-wide evangelization which became a
chart for the son, who said, "the world is my
parish." The mother, Susannah, was possessed
of so many gifts that her son felt that to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
fallen heir to her mental and moral treasures
was, in itself, a gift of God. Gibbon described
his tutor in Oxford as a "man who remembered
that he had a salary to receive and forgot
that he had a duty to perform."</p>

<p>John Wesley had the opposite theory of
life. At seventeen, going to Oxford he won
distinction as a scholar of the finest classical
taste, of the most liberal and manly sentiments,
and one of the finest men of his time.
Elected a Fellow of Lincoln College when
thirty-two years of age, appointed lecturer in
Greek, carrying on his own studies in Arabic
and Hebrew, in poetry and oratory, young
Wesley wrote in his <i>Journal</i> a sentence that
describes the next sixty years of his life:
"Leisure and I have taken leave of each
other." It was true of him in middle life,
and it was to be true of him to the day of
his death.</p>

<p>During the critical years when Wesley was
educating himself, his favourite books were the
<i>Imitation of Christ</i>, by Thomas &agrave; Kempis,
Jeremy Taylor's <i>Purity of Intention</i>, and
William Law's masterpiece, <i>Serious Call</i>. It
was while he was in Oxford that he formed
the habit of reading for one hour before he
outlined the duties of the day. Then came
the two years' visit to the United States, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
brief ministry in Georgia, his friendship with
the Moravians, and that golden hour on May
24, 1738, when he went with Peter B&ouml;ehler
and passed through an experience like that of
Paul on the road to Damascus, that has been
described by the critical historian Lecky,&mdash;"It
is scarcely an exaggeration to say that
the scene which took place at that humble
meeting in Aldersgate Street forms an epoch
in English history." But it is a striking fact
that Wesley's real work did not begin until
he had reached full middle life. It was under
the influence of George Whitefield, the greatest
pulpit orator England has produced, that
Wesley went to Bristol and under pressure by
Whitefield, consented to speak in the open air
to some three thousand people, gathered
about a little eminence. Few careers offer
greater encouragement and inspiration to the
man who at middle-age has yet to find himself.</p>

<p>And what was the secret of his incredible
strength? The secret is very simple. During
each day he kept two or three little islands
of silence and solitude for himself, betwixt
the sermons and crowds. He learned how to
read books on horseback. He never hurried,
and never worried. He preached with physical
restraint, so that public speech became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
form of physical exercise, a life-giving kind of
gymnastics. He learned how to breathe, so
that speaking three, or four and five hours a
day did not injure his vocal cords. Morley, in
his <i>Life of Gladstone</i>, says that at Gravesend,
Gladstone spoke for two hours to an audience
of twenty thousand, and his biographer declares
that physically and intellectually, that
speech was the greatest of Mr. Gladstone's
career. Gladstone was sixty-two years old
when he performed that feat, which is unique
in his career. Wesley's journal is filled with
records like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sunday, August 10, 1786. Preached in the
churchyard to large congregations.</p>

<p>Preached at one <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> to twenty thousand.</p>

<p>At five o'clock to another such congregation.</p>

<p>All at the utmost stretch of my voice.</p>

<p>But my strength was as my day.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven years later, August 23, 1773, his
journal holds this <a name="record" id="record"></a>record:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Preached at Gwennap Pit to above 32,000,
perhaps the first time that a man of seventy
had been heard by 30,000 persons.</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fitchett says that Wesley's voice must have
far outranged Gladstone's. The people all
stood closely packed together. At Bristol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
after the audience had gone, one man measured
the ground from Wesley's stand to the
outskirts of the audience and found it to
be 420 feet. For this reason his biographers
say that Wesley preached more sermons, rode
more miles, worked more hours, printed more
books, and influenced more lives than any
Englishman of his age, or <i>any</i> age. In 1773
he writes, "I am seventy-three years old, and
far abler to preach than I was at twenty-three."
Ten years later, the old man writes,
"I have entered into the eighty-third year of
my age. I am never tired, either with preaching,
writing or travelling." And yet his
emotions had tremendous intensity. He held
thousands of miners in breathless silence for
an hour and a half at a time. When he was
ill, he exclaimed that if he could only go into
the pulpit for two hours, and have a good
sweat he thought he might recover. His
secret of health was "a little more work."
That was the tonic that cured worry and
dissipated all clouds.</p>

<p>The moral courage of John Wesley is one of
the wonderful spectacles of history. He lived
in a brutal, cruel century. The crowds did
not stop with jeers, oaths, vulgar epithets.
It was a time when disputes were marked by
all the savagery of a Spanish bull-fight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Wesley gives the details of these persecutions
and without complaint. The period between
June 1743, and February 1744, was particularly
trying. An organized movement was
carried on to intimidate the people from following
Wesley. In several cities the Methodists
were beaten and plundered by a rabble
that broke into their houses, destroyed their
victuals and goods, threatened their lives, and
abused their women. During that winter
Wesley received many blows, occasionally lost
part of his clothing and was often covered
with dirt. Meanwhile, enemies went on in
advance to sow the towns with wild scandals,
and stir up strife and storm, but Wesley went
on building churches, developing schools,
training lay preachers, organizing his people
to take care of the class during his absence.</p>

<p>Wesley was a scholar, and prepared his sermons
with the greatest care. He was also a
flaming evangelist, and therefore was freed
from what Robertson of Brighton describes as
"the treadmill necessity of being always ready
twice a week with earnest thoughts on solemn
themes." Like Beecher, Wesley was not
afraid of repeating his sermons. Like Wendell
Phillips, he thought a lecturer was never in
shape until he had one hundred nights of
delivery back of him. Having heard a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
man say, "Once in seven years I burn all my
sermons," Wesley answered, "I cannot write
a better sermon on the Good Steward than I
did seven years ago; I cannot write a better
on the Great Assize than I did twenty years
ago; I cannot write a better on the use of
money than I did thirty years ago."</p>

<p>As an orator, Wesley had many wonderful
gifts. Not a large man, he was compact and
strong, with nerves of silk and sinews of steel.
In moments of impassioned speech he seemed
to tower and take on the dimensions of a
giant. His portraits show him to have been
a man of fine figure, and beautiful face, with
firm lips, mobile and sensitive, eyes bright and
kindly. His complexion was very beautiful,
fair, clear and somewhat ruddy. His forehead
was broad, and beautifully curved. His
voice was called the finest instrument of its
kind in England, always saving that of Whitefield.
During his college days he made a
reputation as an accurate scholar, and a keen
and skillful logician. All his life long he retained
his analytic method, and was always
working upon his sermons. He was a master
of keen, arrowy sentences. His sermons
abound in short paragraphs. His illustrations
are simple, but so perfectly related to
his thought, that they become a part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
argument itself. The chief characteristic of
his style is its clearness. He excelled in the
searching force of the application, and tested
the result of each address by the number of
hearers whom he had persuaded to change
their lives at a given moment.</p>

<p>Little by little he developed a kingly
authority. He carried the atmosphere of
gentle supremacy. "How did you know
that Theseus was a god?" The answer was:
"I recognized Apollo by his speech; Mars by
his thunderbolts; Minerva by her wisdom, but
I knew that Theseus was a god, because whatsoever
he did, whether he sat, or whether he
walked or whatsoever he did, he conquered."
John Wesley was a natural king, ruling men
by the divine right of moral supremacy.
One day a mob threatened to tear him in
pieces. "I called," Wesley writes, "for a
chair. Suddenly the winds were hushed, and
all was calm and still; my heart was filled
with love; my eyes with tears; my mouth with
arguments. The leaders were amazed; they
were ashamed; they were melted down; they
devoured every word." At the end of the
sermon the leader, who held a stone in his
hand, with which to strike Wesley, seemed
transformed. He turned to his followers and
shouted, "If any man dares to lift a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
against Mr. Wesley he will have to reckon
with me first!" Those who came to curse
remained to pray.</p>

<p>Wesley has had scores of biographers, and
every one of them seems to have emphasized
the happiness and the serene cheerfulness of
his daily life. If there ever lived a man who
dwelt in constant sunshine, and maintained
unbroken tranquillity and peace amidst endless
storm and tumult, that man was John
Wesley. He cared nothing about a great
house, servants, equipage, money. It is said
that the profits of his various publications
were about $150,000, but he gave this money
away as fast as it came in. He discovered
the simple life long before Pastor Wagner.
He ate sparingly, cared nothing for rich foods
or costly raiment. He loved the temperate
zone, far removed alike from luxury and
poverty. He never wrote a creed. In welcoming
a member into his company he asked
two questions, "Is thine heart right? If it
be, give me thine hand. Dost thou love and
serve God? It is enough. I give thee the right
hand of fellowship." In that spirit, when
members of other churches came to him he
bade them keep their own creed if only "they
did love and serve God, and desired to save
souls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>And so his work spread into every land.
Asbury, the great pioneer, rode his horse to
and fro over the Alleghany Mountains,
preaching in hundreds of settlements between
the Atlantic Coast and the Mississippi River.
Simpson, with his unrivalled eloquence,
travelled from state to state for forty years,
founding churches, charging class leaders,
consecrating lay preachers, placing the torch
in the hand of some gifted youth, and sending
him out to light a thousand other tapers.
Taylor made his way across India with its
three hundred millions, and in every cannibal
island in the South Seas and along the path
through the jungles of Africa, went the followers
of Wesley. It is a wonderful story.
For the man who counted himself the friend
of all the churches and the enemy of none
"has liberalized, broadened and sweetened
every Christian faith."</p>

<p>The year 1741 brought the beginning of
Wesley's plan of world evangelization. He
saw that the millions of the human race would
never be reached by a handful of preachers.
He tells us that it was as if a veil had fallen
from his eyes, after which he saw clearly that
Jesus used lay disciples, both men and women,
for the spread of His life and teaching.
Holding a candle in his hand, Wesley lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
another candle, and watched the flame leap
from taper to taper. He organized each
group of one hundred converts into a class
and pledged them to come together in a meeting,
when each disciple was to tell the story
of what the living Christ had done for him.
He saw that merchants advertised their cotton
and their woollen goods; that manufacturers
went everywhither telling other men the
advantages of the new loom, or locomotive;
and instead of having one minister to confess
Christ before five hundred dumb hearers,
Wesley conceived the idea of dedicating each
of the five hundred hearers, not to dumbness
but to full speech, and to send them forth,
from house to house, and mine to mine, and
school to school.</p>

<p>Scientists tell us that the Gulf Stream, made
up of individual drops of water, each of which
has been warmed by the tropic sun, bathes
England and turns a land that is as far north
as Labrador into a land of fruit and flowers.
And from that hour, if other churches had
one minister, to five hundred disciples, Wesley
dedicated laymen and laywomen to the task
of going forth into all the world to tell the
story of the love of God to sinful men.</p>

<p>The movement he started is still advancing
in the world. It was Wesley who gave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
impulse to Wilberforce, the emancipator, to
Howard, the prison reformer, to Livingstone,
the missionary, to the Booths with their work
for the submerged classes. Above any other
man in modern times he made it plain to the
miner, the peasant, and the criminal, that
they must achieve eminence through penitence
and obedience, love and self-sacrificing service.
Having turned multitudes to righteousness,
his name now shines like the brightness of the
firmament, and will continue to shine like the
stars for ever and ever.</p>

<p>John Wesley mastered another secret&mdash;he
knew how to die gloriously. In his last hours,
Moody, the evangelist, turned with smiles to
a friend, and whispered, "They were all
wrong. There is no valley, and no shadow."
Wesley died with that memorable word upon
his lips, "The best of all is, God is with us."
He preached his last sermon on February 23,
1791. His last letter was addressed to Wilberforce,
and was a protest against the horrors
of slavery. A few weeks before, he had given
the first five days of the new year to the task
of walking through the streets of London,
soliciting alms for the relief of the poor. In
those days his appearance in the street was
the signal for all passers-by to uncover. Men
revered him as a noble saint. He died singing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in the spirit of serene happiness and outbreaking
joy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>I'll praise my Maker while I've breath</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And when my voice is lost in death,</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Great was the power of the soldier, Napoleon;
wonderful the genius of his opponent Wellington,
the victor; marvellous the influence of
Pitt, with his vision of the expansion of England
as a world power; but more wonderful,
a thousand times, the influence of John Wesley,
carried to his grave by six very poor men,
but whose work is memorable, whose influence
is immortal, and whose spirit is inshrined in
the hearts of millions of his grateful followers.</p>

<h2>VII<br />
GARIBALDI<br />
(1807&ndash;1882)</h2>
<h3><i>The Idol of the New Italy</i></h3>

<p>Among the builders of the New Italy,
history has made a large place for
Mazzini, the agitator and author, and for
Cavour, the statesman, but the common
people have kept the first place in their
heart for Garibaldi, the soldier, and hero.
Mazzini was the John the Baptist of the
movement, who descended upon the political
ills and wrongs of his time, carrying a torch
in one hand and a sword in the other. Cavour
was the statesman of the movement, a most
skillful diplomat, who organized political and
moral forces against the foul wrongs found
in the prisons of Naples and the palaces of
Rome. But it was Garibaldi who captured
the imagination of the Italian people, who
turned mobs into regiments, overthrew the
citadels of iniquity, and made possible the
realization of the visions of Mazzini and the
reforms of Cavour.</p>

<p>Unlike the other great men whose stories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
fill the pages of this little book, Garibaldi was
not a man of universal genius; he wrote no
enduring history nor philosophy, he created
no body of laws. In terms of intellect his
gifts were modest. No pamphlet, no great
speech survives his death. He was one of the
common people. But he was born with the
gift of surrender, and he knew how to dedicate
himself to a great cause. Early in his career
Garibaldi allied himself with an unpopular
movement, in the interests of the poor and the
oppressed, and thereby opened the doors of
hope to all men of modest gifts, who are
ambitious to serve their fellows.</p>

<p>The career of this soldier, Garibaldi, forms
one of the most dramatic and fascinating tales
in history. It is a story so unique and unexplainable
that many Italians speak of the
miraculous note in it, the note of mystery.
Garibaldi's mother was a remarkable woman,
who believed that her son had a call from
God to do a great piece of work, and she filled
the soul of the child with the firm belief that
he could not be killed by any sword or bullet
or cannon-ball. This supreme conviction explains,
in part, deliverances that his biographers
tell us were "miraculous." With words
of matchless simplicity, the apostle Paul tells
us the number of times he was stoned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
mobbed, flogged and imprisoned; but the
perils of Garibaldi in the wilderness, in the
city and the sea were scarcely less dramatic.
In his boyhood his father was the captain of
a sailing vessel, who owned and commanded
his own ship and made the ports between
Nice and Constantinople. At fifteen years of
age the boy went to sea; learned to build a
sailing-vessel, to rig the masts, to sail the boat
against opposing winds, and to fight the
pirates who were still occasionally found upon
the seas. And he was barely twenty when,
under the influence of Mazzini, he surrendered
his soul to the spirit of Washington and
Hamilton and dreamed the dream of a second
republic. From that moment, when, heart
and soul, he threw himself into the cause of
liberty, his life was one long chapter of thrilling
adventures and miraculous escapes.</p>

<p>His biography teems with striking incidents.
Once, after enlisting on the side of the revolutionists,
he was on a small vessel going up the
La Plata River. Rounding a bend in the
stream, Garibaldi's little boat was attacked
by two large vessels, that opened fire, cut down
the masts, carried away the sails, and covered
the decks with killed and wounded. As captain
of the boat, Garibaldi wore his red shirt,
and so became the target of the gunners.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
When several of his men tried to drag him
below, he answered, "I can't be killed!" A
few minutes later a shot struck his neck and
cut a part of the jugular vein. Now, many
surgeons say that if the jugular vein be severed
it cannot be healed, because it is always throbbing
and throbbing with each pulse beat, just
as it is said that a shot through the heart is
fatal. A little later the boat struck a sandbar,
and the battle swept to another part of
the river. The physician told Garibaldi that
his wound was fatal, and asked what word he
wished to send home. Garibaldi answered,
"Tell my mother I shall live to be seventy-six."</p>

<p>On another occasion, his place of hiding was
surrounded by a company of soldiers, who
opened fire upon the house. Garibaldi awakened,
flung open the door, took his sword in
one hand and his dagger in the other&mdash;his
ammunition was exhausted&mdash;and rushed forth
against the enemy. From their ambush these
enemies saw his red shirt. They had heard
that no bullet could kill him, and armed as
they were, they fled in every direction, across
fields and into the woods.</p>

<p>At the very outset of his career, Garibaldi's
life was threatened by the State and a price
put upon his head. Under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Mazzini, he had joined a secret society and
been made acquainted with the plans for a
revolution in Italy. The plot was betrayed
by a spy, and in the disguise of a peasant
trying to buy sheep, Garibaldi was forced to
flee across the line into France. Once on
French territory, he abandoned caution and
entered a village inn. "I must have something
to eat," he told the landlord, "I am
starving." His host was suspicious and asked
Garibaldi if he was not a fugitive, to which
the youth replied with open truthfulness,
"Yes, I am an Italian! I fled from soldiers
who would have shot or hung me, had they
been quick enough." . . . "What have
you done?" asked the landlord. Garibaldi
answered: "I met Mazzini. He told me about
the republic in the United States. He said
that the American colonists threw off the yoke
of a tyrant and made a constitution for themselves,
and asked whether the people of Italy
could not break their own fetters. I answered
that Italy should become a republic."</p>

<p>After that bold statement, the landlord
signalled to one of his men, who put his hand
upon Garibaldi's shoulder, saying, "I am an
officer of the French government. Under the
treaty with Italy I am sworn to arrest all
those accused of treason who flee across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
frontier." . . . "Very well," said Garibaldi.
"And now that is settled, give me
something to eat!"</p>

<p>When the servant asked Garibaldi whether
he had money for his dinner, the youth pulled
out his purse. "Since I am going to be either
hung or shot, I may as well have one good
meal before I die!" He then asked two or
three strangers who were in the inn to join
him in his last dinner, and extended that invitation
until there were fifteen or twenty
about the table, singing, telling stories, and
relating incidents of adventure. When
Garibaldi saw that the time had come for his
arrest, since a group of soldiers had appeared
at the door, he arose, and looking out upon
his new friends, said, "Well, the landlord,
who is an officer of the government, has sent
for these soldiers to arrest me. It seems I
have committed treason. I wanted to have a
republic in Italy. So I joined Mazzini's society."
One by one the inmates of the inn
rose. One looked toward the landlord and
said, "Is this true? Are you going to imprison
and shoot this man? Why, this Garibaldi
is a great man, and a good man; I never
saw him before to-night, but before you arrest
him you will have to arrest me." Another
shouted, "Before you shoot Garibaldi, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
will have to shoot me!" A moment later, the
whole company had joined to form a bodyguard
around the brave young stranger. They
lifted Garibaldi to their shoulders. They
dared the officers to arrest him. They carried
him out to the stable behind the inn, filled his
pockets with copper and silver, and paid the
driver to set him twenty miles beyond the
frontier. Four of them rode with him as a
guard to protect him. . . .</p>

<p>Condemned to death, he escaped to South
America, where he plunged at once into the
struggle for liberty there. The story of the
happiness and prosperity of the people of the
United States under a free government had
spread all over the Southern continent. Unfortunately
there were still many men who
believed in autocracy and in the absolutism of
an hereditary despot. Garibaldi at once took
sides. He fought on the sea. He began as a
private sailor, but soon became commander of
the fleet. He fought on the land. He began
as a private soldier, but he ended as a general.
Once he was captured and beaten within an
inch of his life. Once he was taken from a
prison and hung by his hands from a beam.
During those two hours, he tells us, he suffered
the anguish of a hundred deaths.</p>

<p>Then came the dramatic meeting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Anita. One of his soldiers told Garibaldi
about the beauty, bravery and self-sacrifice of
a daughter of a certain rich man. Hearing
that this girl, Anita, had gone to visit a friend
in the village, Garibaldi, with several of his
men, rode to the little store. Drawing rein
before the door of the shop, he sent one of his
men into the store to buy some trifle. In the
upper window stood Anita. Garibaldi turned
his horse and rode close to the door. Looking
up, he met the eyes of Anita, and for a full
minute, without saying a word, the two looked
each into the soul of the other. Suddenly
Garibaldi said, "Se&ntilde;orita! I have never seen
you before. I do not know your name, but
you belong to me! Sooner or later you
will come to me." Anita arose. She
leaned out of the window. In a low voice
she said, "Shall I come now?" And Garibaldi
answered, "I will ride up the street
and return within a moment. Be ready at
this spot." There was just time for
Anita to grasp a cloak and a few articles
of clothing. A moment later, down
the street on a gallop came Garibaldi, followed
by his soldiers. Anita was standing on the
stone step. As Garibaldi dashed by, he put
out his right arm, swept her against his horse
and up to the front of the saddle and dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
away for a ten mile gallop to a little church
whose frightened priest refused to perform
the marriage ceremony without publishing the
banns for the next two Sundays. Anita's
father was of the other political party and the
soldier knew that the consent would never be
given. Garibaldi laid two revolvers upon the
altar and said quietly, "Father, the service
will proceed immediately."</p>

<p>So they were married. Anita was well
educated as well as brave and very beautiful.
In a fit of anger and hate, her father organized
a group of conspirators who were to receive
a rich reward for killing Garibaldi. It
was Anita who discovered the plot and fired
the pistol that led the conspirators to believe
that they had been discovered. Later, a
drunken mob discovered that she was alone in
a little house. The leader of the despot organized
a group at midnight, all of them
crazed with liquor. They set fire to the house
and then rushed in, only to find that Garibaldi
had not yet returned home. And when
these drunken brigands had beaten Anita
down and knocked her into unconsciousness
Garibaldi returned unarmed save for his
dagger. One by one he took these eight men
who were standing about the unconscious girl,
and one by one they went down before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>His life in South America, extending over
a period of fourteen years, was one long
struggle against tyranny and oppression.
Fighting first in the revolt against Brazil, then
joining the patriots of Uruguay, he formed
the Italian Legion, and in the spring of 1846
won the battles of Cerro and Sant'Antonio,
assuring the freedom of Uruguay. Refusing
all honours and recompense he returned to
Italy, having heard of the incipient struggle
for liberty at home. He landed at Nice in
1848 and, forming a volunteer army of 3,000,
plunged at once into the struggle against the
French. His troops were largely students,
mere lads, many of them never before under
fire, and the troops of the enemy included the
legions of France, Austria and Spain. The
climax of the struggle came with his wonderful
retreat through central Italy toward
Venice, pursued by four armies. Only his
consummate generalship and the matchless
loyalty of his men saved them all from
annihilation. During this retreat, Garibaldi
was accompanied by his wife, Anita, who had
cut off her hair and mounted a horse, and who
wore men's clothing to avoid observation.
Realizing at length that the struggle was hopeless,
Garibaldi issued an order, releasing his
soldiers, and bidding them return to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
homes. And leaving Anita hidden at the
house of a friend, he himself took refuge in a
cave in the hills, after the fashion of David
the Fugitive and Robert Bruce&mdash;a hiding-place
from which he continued to send forth
his military orders.</p>

<p>Among the many wonder tales of this
period, many of which are traditional and
perhaps untrustworthy, there is one that bears
the stamp of reality. One night Garibaldi
was asleep in the cave. A faithful soldier was
on guard. Suddenly the soldier saw a torch
waving in the blackness of the valley below.
The torch was spelling a signal, but the guard
was ignorant of its significance. He hurried
into the cave and wakened his leader. Garibaldi
knew the signal&mdash;it told of the approaching
death of Anita. With instant decision,
he started down the mountainside; made his
way to the house of a peasant, and, despatching
a man in advance, found and mounted a
horse for the long ride to the village where
Anita lay dying. Ahead of him, the galloping
rider warned the countryside, shouting
that Garibaldi was coming and commanding
every man to go into his house and close the
door, that no man might see the face of the
fugitive, for whose person a reward had long
been offered. The hurrying hero changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
horses, and when the day was nearly done,
rode into the village to the house where his
beloved wife lay dying. In the night, wrestling
with the death angel, Garibaldi was defeated,
and left desolate. When the morning
came, he wrapped Anita's body in the flag of
the new republic, and buried her in the corner
of the garden. That night he rode back to
his handful of fugitives, hidden in a defile of
the mountains.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1850 that, once more
a fugitive, Garibaldi sailed for America, and
coming to New York, settled as a chandler on
Staten Island. He had a brother living in
New York, and the brother had never tired
of writing letters about the wonderful opportunities
in the United States. It was an era
of candles. Kerosene oil was but little used,
while gas and electricity were unknown. As
a cattle drover in the Argentine Republic,
Garibaldi had seen the great herds on the
ranches, the tanneries filled with hides, the
great stores of tallow in the warehouses. He
entered into an agreement with a friend in
South America to keep him supplied with
tallow, and over at St. George he started his
little candle factory. Later, he became a
trading skipper and in 1854 was able to return
to Italy with funds sufficient to purchase the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
tiny island of Caprera, and build the house
which thenceforth was to be his home.</p>

<p>Throughout the four years in America and
on the sea, he had never once ceased to dream
his dream of liberty and a republic to be set
up in Italy. In 1851, while he was living
here, Louis Kossuth, the Hungarian patriot,
had landed in New York and received an ovation.
While here, Kossuth had perfected the
constitution for the republic he proposed to
set up in Hungary, and had announced his
plans for the overthrow of the royal family,
and the enthronement of a president. Garibaldi
kept in touch with every such new movement.
He read the daily papers of New
York; met the political leaders of the city
and everywhere heard discussions as to Washington
and Franklin, Hamilton and Webster.
The fire burned ever more fiercely in his
heart. He wrote a friend saying: "Whenever
they are ready, the people of Italy can
shake off the old tyranny that has come down
from the middle ages, just as a peasant in the
forest shakes the fallen leaves from his coat."</p>

<p>And during his trading days, while on a
voyage to Hong Kong, he dreamed another
dream, of a different kind. Half-way across
the ocean, he dreamed that he saw his mother
kneeling at the foot of a white cross. He fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
upon his knees beside it and heard her say:
"Fight only for liberty, my son! Fight
only for liberty!" It was his birthday, the
fifth of May. Months later, he discovered
that on that very night his mother had passed
away in the little house in Nice. From that
hour he dedicated the remainder of his life
to the liberation of his native land.</p>

<p>One day, while he was following the plow
on his little island farm near the coast of
Sardinia, a messenger brought word that an
Austrian regiment had landed on the shore of
Sardinia and seized the island for Austria.
Once more, Garibaldi plunged into the
struggle. For a year he fought at the head
of Italian volunteers under Victor Emmanuel,
against the Austrians, liberating the Alpine
territory as far as the frontier of Tyrol.
Then, in retirement at Genoa, came another
summons&mdash;a letter telling the story of the
sufferings of the liberal leaders in Naples.
King Francis, the tyrant of Naples, had been
arresting by wholesale men suspected of
sympathy with free institutions. The despot
filled the dungeons, crowded the upper cells,
packed the corridors between the rows of cells,
until there was not room for men even to lie
down upon the floor. Without any warning
whatsoever, the soldiers would appear at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
home of some citizen. Without any hearing,
much less a trial, men were sent to the royal
prison and jammed into corridors already
filled to suffocation with murderers, brigands,
thieves, forgers. The under-cells dripped
with filth. There was no sanitation. Vermin,
rats, every form of vice and uncleanliness
were there. In the stifling heat some smothered
to death.</p>

<p>Gladstone was at this time in Italy. One
day he reached Naples, en route for Pompeii
and Herculaneum. Calling upon the British
Consul, he was told about these prisons, that
were death-traps. He hurried back to London.
He used his official position as a statesman
under Queen Victoria to address a letter to
the civilized peoples of the world. A wave
of indignation and horror swept over the
capitals of Europe. The hour had struck for
Italy. Garibaldi headed a tiny army and
started south to the attack. Naples was besieged.
After weeks of fighting, and oft
wounded, one day with clothes covered with
blood he addressed a handful of citizens:
"Soldiers, what I have to offer you is this&mdash;hunger,
thirst, cold, heat, no pay, no barracks,
no rations, frequent alarms, forced
marches, charges at the point of the bayonet.
Whoever loves honour and fatherland, follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
me!" Ah, Garibaldi knew that there is a
latent instinct of heroism in every human
heart. Why are there few boys going into
the ministry to-day? Because the task has
become too easy. Here are the young fisherman,
John; the young physician, Luke; the
young rabbi, Paul;&mdash;offer them stones, scourges,
blows, fagot-fires, martyrdom, and they
will leap into the breach. After that appeal
of Garibaldi four thousand men followed their
leader to battle. Soon the bloody tyrant of
Naples was driven from his city.</p>

<p>Then came the long campaigns in the south,
with Garibaldi's entrance into the city of
Palermo; the struggle in Sicily, the siege of
the fortress at Massina, the triumphal march
through Calabria, his victory at Naples, culminating
with that great day, September 7th,
1860, when he handed over a fleet and an
army to Victor Emmanuel. Having endured
every form of peril, hunger, and cold, with
loss of blood through many wounds, the
citizens of Naples, after the expulsion of their
recreant King, turned with one heart and
offered him the throne for his leverage, and
the palace for his home. But Garibaldi refused
the throne, because he believed in the
republic, and no bribe nor blandishment could
swerve him a hair's breadth from his conviction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
that the fairest, stablest form of government
was self-government.</p>

<p>On the day of his entrance, the people went
out and carried him into the city upon their
shoulders. All along the central street he was
welcomed with the words, "Secundo Washington"&mdash;"Second
Washington." For what
Lincoln did for the three million slaves, and
what Washington did for the three million
colonists, Garibaldi had wrought for three
million downtrodden Italian peasants. But
having freed the people from cruel oppression,
he sent for Victor Emmanuel, the ruler who
had insulted him, and said, looking toward
his army and the captains of his navy, "I
have not been trained for civil government!
I therefore abdicate my position as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, and I
turn these instruments of defense and offense
over to you." History holds the story of no
sublimer act of disinterested patriotism.
That deed insured a united Italy, the chief aim
of Garibaldi's life.</p>

<p>From that hour his fame, his place in the
history of Italy were fully established. During
the next few years many honours and
offices were offered Garibaldi, all of which
he consistently declined. He was the last
hero of the heroic age of the new Italy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
most popular, the most legendary, in the sense
that he resembled a hero of old romance. A
faithful soldier, who might have been a king;
a hero always a hero, even to his own servants
and amid sordid circumstances; unspoiled by
the admiration of the world and the adulation
of his friends; a warrior with hands unstained
by plunder, cruelty or the useless shedding of
blood, he remained to the end one of the few
characters for whom neither wealth nor rank
ever offered temptation. Michelet, the French
historian, wrote of him, "There is one hero in
all Europe&mdash;one! I do not know a second.
All his life is a romance; and since he had the
greatest reasons for hatred to France, who
had stolen his Nice, caused him to be fired
upon at Aspromonte, fought against him at
Mentana, you guess that it was this man who
flew (during the Franco-German War) to
immolate himself for France. And how
modestly, withal! Nothing mattered it to
him that he was placed in obscure posts quite
unworthy of him. Grand man, my Garibaldi!
My single hero! Always loftier than fortune!
How sublimely does his memory rise and swell
toward the future!"</p>

<p>In retrospect, strategists tell us that Garibaldi
knew little and cared less about the usual
military tactics, or the plans of organization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
and transport taught in military schools. His
wonderful career, with its many and brilliant
victories, is explained by the supreme influence
which his person exercised. Knowing neither
danger nor fear, rushing into the most perilous
spots, his very daring fascinated and inspired
his followers. "He had all the instincts
of the lion; not merely the headlong courage,
but the far nobler qualities of magnanimity,
placability, self-denial. His impulses were all
generous, his motives invariably upright, his
conscience unerring." The most loving among
great leaders, the least hating among great
soldiers, he was devoid of all personal ambition,
as he was devoid of all rancour and
malice. He was one of the most picturesque
leaders, one of the most dramatic figures in all
history. "None could fail to admire or be
inspired by the sight of him on the field of
battle, as with clear, ringing silver voice, his
lion-like face, his plain red shirt and grey
trousers, he sat his horse with perfect ease
and calm, guiding his soldiers by plunging
into the thick of the enemy and trusting his
troops to follow."</p>

<p>Garibaldi's moral courage was always the
equal of his physical bravery. During the
siege of Rome, when he was defending the
city against the forces of Austria and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
France, the enemy located the house from
which he was directing the defense. Cannonball,
smashing through the roof, carried away
his flag; bullets aimed with unerring accuracy
entered the windows, and buried themselves
in the walls. While the others ran to the
cellar, Garibaldi walked out the front door,
stood on the steps, and calmly supervised the
carrying to a place of safety of all the important
military papers. That night the Roman
leaders sent messengers to Garibaldi, and insisted
upon surrender. At last Garibaldi exclaimed,
"Is it not enough that I must fight
our enemies? Has it come to this, that with
equal strength I must oppose my friends?"
And then, he lifted his broken sword, and exclaimed:
"On my monument write these
words, 'A man who never surrendered to the
enemies of human freedom!'"</p>

<p>Where were the hidings of this man's
power? History tells of no leader who was
so idolized. For Garibaldi men braved martyrdom.
For him, women endured starvation.
Priests risked the anathema of their masters.
Boys, wearing the red shirt, flung themselves
upon the bayonets of Austria and France.
Captured, they were tortured by the enemy,
but died smiling rather than betray Garibaldi.
There is a tradition not mentioned by his best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
biographer, that many Italians claim is absolutely
true. Once when he was in hiding, he
appeared at midnight in the public square of
Naples. The city was completely controlled
by the King, who had set a price upon Garibaldi's
head. But many of the people were
secret followers of Garibaldi, who wished to
confer with one of his friends in the prison.
Recognizing a policeman who was his friend,
Garibaldi put his fingers upon his lips and
drew his cloak the closer about his face.
After a whispered word the soldier led Garibaldi
to the entrance of the prison. Another
whispered word and the great iron gate swung
open. A second whispered conversation and
the inner gate opened. Within, another
guard stooped while Garibaldi whispered in
his ear. A little later, out of a cell, came that
captured friend of Garibaldi. The hero asked
and obtained the information he desired.
Putting his two fingers upon his lips, Garibaldi
saluted, and was led to the inner gate.
Having passed through he put those two
fingers upon his lips, saluted, and was led to
the outer gate. Putting his fingers upon his
lips he saluted again, and with an officer who
had become his guide, walked hurriedly to an
alley, where he stepped into his carriage,
where he saluted and disappeared in the darkness&mdash;whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
cellar or attic no man knows
unto this day. The following morning Garibaldi
led his troops into battle. Now tell me,
where is there in history of human heroism a
chapter more thrilling than this story of
Garibaldi?</p>

<p>The truism that men without fault are
generally men without force, is well illustrated
in the life of Garibaldi. It is the strongest,
most adventurous, romantic and troublous
career in history. There are many blots upon
his scutcheon, just as there are many yellow
spots upon the front columns of the Parthenon,
and nothing is gained by calling the roll of
faults rehearsed by his critics and enemies.
"The evil that men do lives after them;
the good is oft interred with their bones."
Remember the story of the farmer in Sardinia
who came home at night, sick because
he had lost a favourite lamb, and
how the next morning Garibaldi returned
with the little dumb creature wrapped in
his blanket and lying upon his bosom.
Remember, how at Palermo, Garibaldi came
out of the battlefield unshaken, but at
sight of the little orphans in the asylum
crying for food the great soldier burst into
tears. Even when they led him to the palace
and called him "Your Excellency," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
frowned and moved to the lighthouse, where,
the idol of his people, he lived in a tiny room
with no furniture but a couch and a stool.
Once he was offered great riches if he would
go out to China and lead a regiment and ship
slaves to South America, but he answered
that "Not all the wealth of the Indies could
induce him to buy and sell human flesh."
After his long campaigns and victories for the
people of Uruguay the new government sent
him a title deed to an enormous tract of land
and thousands of heads of cattle, but he tore
up the deeds because he had fought for liberty.
In time of plague he became a nurse, in time
of shipwreck he risked his life to save his
comrades.</p>

<p>It is true that for some years, under the influence
of two friends who were foreigners,
he passed under the influence of their own
materialism and doubt, and he tells us that
from that hour it seemed as if the spirit of his
mother and of Anita had both deserted him.
During the last years of his life he became
almost a hermit and seemed to be confused
by the problems of the world in which he
lived. But he had been starved, imprisoned,
tortured, betrayed and shot down. The real
Garibaldi speaks in this message that he
addressed to the people of Italy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>"I am a Christian and I speak to Christians.</p>

<p>"I love and venerate the religion of Christ.</p>

<p>"Christ came into the world to deliver
humanity from slavery.</p>

<p>"You who are here have the duty to educate
the people.</p>

<p>"Educate them to be Christians.</p>

<p>"Education gives liberty.</p>

<p>"On a strong and wholesome education for
the people depend the liberty and greatness
of Italy!</p>

<p>"Viva Victor Emmanuel!</p>

<p>"Viva Italia!</p>

<p>"Viva Christianity!"</p>

<h2>VIII<br />
JOHN RUSKIN<br />
(1819&ndash;1900)</h2>
<h3><i>And the Diffusion of the Beautiful</i></h3>

<p>The genius of John Ruskin's message is
in a single sentence: "Life without industry
is guilt, and industry without art and
education is brutality." He held that all the
doing that makes commerce is born of the
thinking that makes scholars, and that all the
flying of looms and the whirling of spindles
begins with the quiet thought of some scholar,
hidden in a closet, or sequestered in a cloister.
He never made the mistake of supposing that
education would change a ten-cent boy into a
thousand-dollar-a-year man, but he <i>did</i> know
that there is some power in Nature that will
transform a seed into a sheaf, an acorn into
an oak, and that the truth will change a child
into a sage, a statesman, a seer, a man with
a message for his century.</p>

<p>Ruskin wrote many volumes to prove that
wealth is not in raw material;&mdash;not in iron,
not in wood, not in stone, not in cotton, not in
wool. Wealth is largely in the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
put into the raw material. Pig-iron is worth
twenty dollars a ton, but intelligence turns that
ton of iron into a ton of tempered hair-springs,
and it is worth perhaps ten thousand dollars
a ton. The clay in Rodin's <i>Thinker</i> represents
a value of a few francs, but the idea in
the <i>Thinker</i> brought 150,000 francs. On the
sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of
Queen Victoria, an editor offered Rudyard
Kipling $1,000 for a Commemoration poem.
The paper, ink and the pen stand for a few
pennies; all the rest of the $1,000 was for a
trained intellect. The average income of a
family in the United States to-day is not far
from $2,000. That income could be carried
up to $4,000 if our workers would only double
the intelligence, efficiency and loyalty put
into the raw material they handle!</p>

<p>The career of Edison illustrates the industrial
value of one informed intellect to the
nation. In 1910, business men in the United
States had invested in the expired patents of
Thomas Edison six billion seven hundred
millions of dollars. These factories brought
in an annual income of a billion and seventy
millions of dollars. To-day, half-a-dozen Edisons,
the one showing us how to burn the coal
in the ground, the other taking nitrogen out
of the air, another showing us how to transmute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
metals, another attacking the enemies of
the cotton, the fruits and the grains, with a
teacher who would show the parents of the
country how successfully to assault intellectual
and moral illiteracy, would easily double our
annual income. What our country&mdash;what
every country&mdash;needs is an invasion of knowledge
and sound sense. Therefore Ruskin's
message, "the first business of the nation is
the manufacture of souls of a good quality."</p>

<p>During his lifetime John Ruskin wrote
some forty volumes. Between the ages of
twenty and thirty he wrote <i>Modern Painters</i>,
dealing with the claims of cloud, sun, shower,
wave, shrub and flower, land, sea, and sky
upon man's intellectual and moral life. He
held that the open-air world is man's best college
and the forces of the winter and the summer
his best teachers. From thirty to forty
he wrote the <i>Lectures on Architecture</i>, and
<i>Stones of Venice</i>, with many studies of the
galleries, towers, and cathedrals of Florence
and Rome. In these books his thought is that
the soul of the people within determines the
painting, architecture and civilization of the
state without. From forty to fifty he wrote
many books on the claim of the beautiful upon
man's spiritual life, and insisted that those
claims were binding not less upon the working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
people and the peasants in factory and
field, than upon the scholar in his library and
the artist in his studio.</p>

<p>From fifty to sixty he wrote his <i>Fors Clavigera</i>,
his <i>Time and Tide</i>, <i>Munera Pulveris</i>,
and <i>Unto This Last</i>, studies of the problems
of wealth and poverty, of labour and capital.
He tells us that men, to-day, are charmed with
the glitter of gold and silver as young birds
are charmed with the glitter of snakes' eyes;
that the business man is divinely called to
serve through property; that there is, however,
such a thing as a despotism of wealth;
that the property of some millionaires represents
the breaking of the strength and the will
of competitors and the paralysis of the forces
of the people, so that what seems to be wealth,
in verity is only "the gilded index of far-reaching
ruin, a wreckers' handful of coin,
gleaned from the beach to which he has beguiled
an argosy; the camp follower's bundle
of rags, unwrapped from the breasts of goodly
soldiers dead, the purchase pieces of potter's
fields, wherein shall be buried together the
citizen and the stranger."</p>

<p>And then Ruskin bent himself to what he
believed to be the real task of his life, the
writing of a series of books on the problems of
labour and capital, in the hope that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
save the State from trampled cornfields and
from bloody streets. But just at the supreme
moment in his career his health gave way,
and he never completed his studies of the
<i>Robber King</i>, the <i>Rust Kings</i>, the <i>Moth King</i>
and the <i>Hero Kings</i>. John Ruskin died believing
himself to be an unfulfilled prophecy,
in that he was unable to complete these books
for which he believed all his life had been
one long preparation. But in reality he was
a prophet who gave forth a message that is
slowly transforming the institutions of mankind.</p>

<p>A full understanding of Ruskin's life-work
begins with an outlook upon his contribution
to modern social reform. Biographers often
identify a great reform with one man's name,
as if this man, single handed, had wrought
the social transformation. Thus they speak
of Howard as the reformer of prisons; of
Shaftesbury as the author of the Poor Acts; of
Cobden as the author of the Corn Laws;
of Lincoln, as the emancipator of slaves; of
Booth as the founder of the City Colony, the
Home Colony, the Farm Colony. But strictly
speaking, thousands of leaders of the movement
for the abolition of slavery stood behind
the forces of Wilberforce in England, and
Lincoln in the United States. Not otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
many biographers have claimed too much for
the influence of Ruskin, certainly more than
the master would have claimed for himself.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his career Ruskin
started a movement to diffuse the beautiful in
the life of the people. For centuries the
beautiful had been concentrated in the temples
of Athens, the palaces and galleries of Italy,
the museums of Paris and London, in the
manor houses of the landed gentry. Meanwhile
the poor people of Athens, Venice and
Florence lived in huts, wore leather garments,
ate crusts, dwelt amid ugliness, squalor and
filth. Ruskin dreamed a dream of the beautiful
put into the life of the common people.
He found that Sheffield, with its smoking
chimneys and grimy streets, had been spoken
of as the ugliest factory town in England.
Therefore Ruskin went to Sheffield, hired a
building, installed therein his paintings, etchings,
and illuminated missals, and hired a few
instructors to help him diffuse the beautiful
in the daily life of the people. He brought in
men who made the implements of the dining-room,
and showed them how to make the knife,
the fork, the spoon, the table linen, minister to
the sentiment of taste and refinement. He
brought in men who made wall-papers for the
poor man's house, and showed the craftsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
how to make the colours soft and warm, delicate
and beautiful. He interested himself in
beautiful furniture. He wrought with William
Morris for a more beautiful type of illustrations
in books and magazines. He denounced
the ugliness of the houses and clothing
and bridges and railways. He insisted
that women should have beautiful garments,
the youth read beautiful books, the men ride
in beautiful cars, the families live in beautiful
little houses, the children play upon beautiful
carpets and look upon walls that had one or
two beautiful pictures. John Ruskin laboured,
and others wrought with him, and now at last
we have entered into the fruit of their labours.
To-day the beautiful, once concentrated in
temples, palaces, and cathedrals, is diffused
in the life of the common people.</p>

<p>In the same fashion Ruskin started a movement
among the working men for a diffusion
of sound learning. The St. George Guild
represents the first University Extension
Course and the first Chautauqua system our
world ever knew. More than fifty years
ago he worked out his plan to carry the knowledge
given to rich men's sons in their lecture
halls and libraries to the working people, who
were to carry on their studies in the evening
after the day's labour was over. He laid out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
course of studies for these working men,
planned the organization of lecture centers,
gave us the outline of the University Extension
Course of lectures, induced many men in
England to go from one working man's guild
and club to another, and after Ruskin's health
broke down, the men in the faculty of Oxford
University took Ruskin's mother-idea, and
developed it into the University Extension
Course of lectures. Brought to our country
that idea has spread through these lecture
courses carried on in great halls in the winter,
in tents and open-air assemblies in the summer.</p>

<p>We say much of our Social Settlement
Work, and trace these thousands of settlements
in the tenement-house region of great
cities back to Arnold Toynbee's work, and
that of Canon Barnett, in the East End of
London. But we must remember that when
Ruskin was lecturing in Oxford to some of the
richest boys in Great Britain he told them
that every boy who consumed more than he
produced was a pauper and that the more the
youth received from his ancestors and the
State, the larger his debt to those who were
less fortunate. He believed that every gifted
boy should keep in touch, not only with his
own class, but with all classes, and that every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
youth would do well to do some physical work
every day. Ruskin and his students built a
road outside of Oxford, and the foreman of
the gang of students was young Arnold Toynbee.
Toynbee admired and loved Ruskin, as a
young pupil and disciple loves a noble teacher
and a great master.</p>

<p>After his health broke down, Ruskin gave
up his work in Whitechapel Road and urged
Arnold Toynbee to give himself to the problems
of the poor, and when Ruskin's health
gave way completely, it was Toynbee who rewrote
his lectures on labour and capital and
gave them a new form in his <i>Industrial Revolution
in Great Britain</i>. The time came when
Arnold Toynbee broke down with overwork
and brain fever, as his master had broken before
him, and his friend Canon Barnett raised
the money to make Toynbee Hall a permanent
institution. But the seed of the Social Settlement
movement was John Ruskin's brief
career in the tenement region of the East End,
and the first full fruit was in his disciple's
Toynbee Hall and in Canon Barnett's noble
work at St. Jude's. Little by little the Social
Settlement Idea spread, until in the tenement
regions of Manchester, Birmingham, New
York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco,
gifted men and women of wealth, leisure and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
patrician position, began to give their lives to
the neglected poor.</p>

<p>Not less striking, the influence of Ruskin
upon the plans of General Booth. Long before
the book called <i>In Darkest England and
the Way Out</i> was published, Ruskin founded
his co&ouml;perative printing press in a little colony
outside of London. One of his biographers
has told the story of Ruskin's plan to make the
men and women in the poorhouses self-supporting,
happy and useful. This biographer
has never fully established the connection between
that first co&ouml;perative colony of Ruskin,
and Booth's plans for the City Colony, the
Farm Colony and the Foreign Colony. But
one thing is certain:&mdash;Ruskin had a pioneer
mind. Instead of his chief interest being in
mountains and clouds, in wave and flower,
cathedrals, pictures, marbles, illuminated
missals, the overmastering enthusiasm of his
life was people, and his real message was a
message of social reform. When long time
has passed, Ruskin's fame will rest upon his
work as a social reformer, a man who loved
the poor and weak.</p>

<p>Not less significant, his views of education,
that have leavened all modern schools whatsoever.
Matthew Arnold defined culture as
"a familiarity with the best that has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
been done in literature." Ruskin insisted
that there were thousands of scholars living
in their libraries, surrounded by books, who
were perfectly familiar with the best that has
ever been thought or done, but whose knowledge
was all but worthless, because it was
selfish. He looked upon the informed man as
a sower, going forth to sow the seed of truth
over the wide land. All selfish culture is like
salt in a barrel; the salt has no power to save
unless it is scattered. Selfish culture is like
seed corn in the granary, important for a
harvest. Under Ruskin's influence many of
his friends gave an evening or two a week to
lectures before his working men's clubs, his
art groups, and his classes for the improvement
of the handicrafts.</p>

<p>No modern author has made so much of
vision, or tried so hard to teach people how
to see. Many teachers think that education
is stuffing the pocket of memory with a mass
of facts. When the mind is filled so that it
cannot hold another truth, the youth receives
a diploma. Ruskin held that education was
teaching the child how to see everything true
and beautiful in land and sea and sky. "For
a thousand great speakers, there is only one
great thinker; for a thousand great thinkers,
there is only one great see-er; we cut out one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
'e' and leave it seer, but the true poet and
sage is simply the see-er." The millions are
blind to the signals hanged out from the
battlements of cloud. Isaac Newton was a
see-er,&mdash;he saw an apple falling from the
tree; saw a moon falling through space, and
gave us the law of gravity. Columbus was
a see-er. In a crevice in a bit of driftwood,
tossed upon the shore of Spain, he saw a
strange pebble, and his imagination leaped
from the driftwood to the unknown forest
from whence it came, from that bright piece
of stone to the mountain range of which it was
a part. Columbus had the seeing eye, and
discovered the continent hidden behind the
clouds.</p>

<p>Not otherwise the geologist sees the handwriting
of God upon the rock-pages; the astronomer
sees His writing upon the pages of
the sky; the physiologist reads His writing on
the pages of the human body; the moralist
deciphers the writing on the tablets of the
mind and the heart. The beginning of Wordsworth's
fame was the hour when his eyes
were opened, and he saw man appearing upon
the horizon, and like a bright spirit trailing
clouds of glory, coming from God who is
man's home. It was the inner sight of Wordsworth's
soul that was "the bliss of solitude."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
It was his power of vision that enabled him
to look out upon the field, yellow as gold, a
vision that lingered long in his memory when
he said, "and then my heart with rapture
thrills, and dances with the daffodils."</p>

<p>It is useless for people who are colour-blind
to look at Rembrandt's portrait. It is folly
for people who cannot follow a tune to buy
a ticket for a symphony concert. Men who
by neglect atrophy the spiritual faculty, or by
sin cut gashes in the nerve of conscience, will
soon exclaim, in the spirit of the fool, "There
is no God," just as the blind man is certain
that there is no sun. The old black ex-slave,
Sojourner Truth, once illustrated this principle.
In those days excitement ran high.
Northern merchants, fearful of losing their
trade with Southern cities, frowned upon any
one who dared criticize "the peculiar institution"
of the South. One day, in New York,
Sojourner Truth, just escaped from slavery,
went to an Abolition Meeting, hoping for an
opportunity of making a plea for the emancipation
of her race. When the black woman,
with her gnarled hands, and face seamed
with pain and sorrow, arose to speak, a young
newspaper reporter slammed his book upon
the table, and stamped his way down the aisle
toward the door. Just before he reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
door, Sojourner Truth stretched out her long
black finger and said, "Wait a minute, honey!
You goin' 'way 'cause of me? Listen, honey&mdash;I
would give you some ideas to take home with
you to your newspaper, but I see you ain't got
nothing to carry 'em in!" . . . Homely
but forceful illustration of an old truth. The
angel of truth and the angel of beauty, leaning
from the battlements of heaven, oft
whispers, "Oh, my children! I would fain
give you a new tool, a new painting, a new
science, but you have no eyes to see the vision,
and no ears to hear the sweetest music that
ever fell from heaven's battlements." It is
the man of vision who founds the new school
of painting, or the new reform or the new
liberty. The visions of the idealist to-day become
the laws and institutions of to-morrow.</p>

<p>In this power of the open eye, Ruskin found
the secret of daily happiness, and mental
growth. No one knew better than John
Ruskin that the millions of working men and
women would never be able to make their way
to the galleries of Paris and Madrid, of Florence
and Venice, to St. Peter's or the Parthenon,
much less have time, leisure and money
for travel unto the far-off ends of the earth.
Therefore he taught the people how to see the
wonders of God, in every fluted blade of grass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
in every bush that blazed with beauty, and
blazing, was not consumed. He proved that
he who knows how to see will find the common
clod to be a casket filled with gems, and that
the sky that looks down upon all workers,
spreads out scenes of such loveliness and
beauty as to make travel to distant lands
unnecessary!</p>

<p>And yet, for the most part, men turn their
eyes toward the sky only in moments of utter
idleness and insipidity. "One says it has
been wet, and another, it has been windy, and
another, it has been warm. But who, among
the whole chattering crowd, can tell me of the
forms and precipices of the chain of tall white
mountains that girded the horizon at noon
yesterday? Who saw the narrow sunbeam
that came out of the south, and smote
upon their summits, until they melted and
mouldered away in a dust of blue rain? Who
saw the dance of the dead clouds, when the
sunlight left them last night, and the west
wind blew them before it like withered leaves?
All has passed, unregretted, and unseen. Not
in the clash of the hail nor the drift of the
whirlwind, are the highest characters developed.
God is not in the earthquake, nor in
the fire, but in the still small voice. Blunt
and low those faculties of our nature, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
can only be addressed through lamp-black
and lightning."</p>

<p>The whole world owes Ruskin an immeasurable
debt for this: that he taught us how to
see the beauty in the great imperial palace in
which man hath his home.</p>

<p>In his defense of Turner, the world's
greatest landscape painter, Ruskin advanced
his theory of first seeing accurately, and then,
through the creative imagination, carrying up
to ideal perfection flowers, faces and landscapes
often marred by the storms and upheavals
of life. It is altogether probable that
John Ruskin saw as accurately the scene of
loveliness as Turner himself. It seems quite
certain that Ruskin was altogether unique in
his capacity for enjoyment. It was not
simply that his eyes saw accurately, and his
intellect registered his impressions without
flaw, but that his imagination and his emotions
were sensitive to the last degree, as sensitive
as the silken threads of an &AElig;olian harp that
responds to the lightest wind that blows.
Many people know the intense flavour of a
strawberry, but Ruskin's soul was pierced
with an intense and tumultuous pleasure at
the sight of the clouds piled up upon the
mountains. He loved Nature with all the
passion with which Dante loved Beatrice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
In Ruskin's forty odd volumes the scholar
can find registered a hundred experiences
in the presence of the mountain glory and
the mountain gloom, in which this delight
and happiness sent his whole body shivering
with the piercing intensity that shook the soul
of Romeo during his passionate interview with
Juliet. Coarse natures, gluttonous, avaricious,
full of hate, can no more understand
the happiness of Ruskin's life than a deaf man
can understand Mozart's rapture, when he
listened to the music in the cathedral. Not
even a tornado can make a crowbar vibrate,
but the flutter of a lark's wing can set a silken
thread vibrating and singing.</p>

<p>Ruskin has spread out, like a rich map, the
story of the people who educated him. The
overmastering influence in his life was that
of his mother. He tells us that he received
from his home in childhood the priceless gift
of peace, in that he had never seen a
"moment's trouble or disorder in any household
matter, or anything whatever done in a
hurry or undone in due time." To this gift
was added the gift of obedience. "I obeyed
word, or lifted finger, of father or mother,
simply as a ship her helm; not only without
idea of resistance but as necessary to me in
every moral action as the law of gravity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
leaping. To the gifts of peace and obedience
my parents added the gift of Faith, in that
nothing was ever promised me that was not
given; nothing ever threatened me that was
not inflicted, and nothing ever told me that
was not true." And to these was added the
habit of fixed attention with both eyes and
mind&mdash;this being the main practical faculty of
his life, causing Mazzini to say of Ruskin that
he had "the most analytic mind in Europe."</p>

<p>The books from which Ruskin had his style
in childhood were Walter Scott's novels,
Pope's translation of the <i>Iliad</i>, Defoe's <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, and
above all, the Bible. "My mother forced me,
by steady and daily toil, to learn long chapters
of the Bible by heart; as well as to read it
every syllable through aloud, hard names and
all, from Genesis to the Apocalypse, about
once a year; and to that discipline, patient,
accurate, and resolute, I owe much of my
general power of taking pains, and the best
part of my taste in literature." The great
chapters of the Bible from which Ruskin says
he had his style included the fifteenth and
twentieth of Exodus; the twenty-third Psalm,
and also the thirty-second, ninetieth, ninety-first,
one hundred and third, one hundred and
twelfth, one hundred and nineteenth, one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and thirty-ninth, the Sermon on the
Mount, the conversion of Paul, his vision on
the road to Damascus, Paul's Ode to Love and
Immortality. "These chapters of the Bible,"
Ruskin says, "were the most precious, and, on
the whole, the one essential part of my education."</p>

<p>Ruskin's message upon education is of vital
importance to the people of our republic.
Strictly speaking, education should teach each
citizen to think aright upon every subject of
importance, and to live a life that is worthy,
making the most out of the gifts received from
God and one's ancestors. Ruskin traced the
national faults and miseries of England, to
illiteracy and the lack of education in the art
of living. The inevitable result of this illiteracy
was that England "despises literature,
despises compassion, and concentrates the soul
on silver." From this illiteracy came physical
ugliness, envy, cowardice, and selfishness,
instead of physical beauty, courage and affection.
To the dry facts taught, therefore, he
proposed to add inspiration, and the art of
seeing.</p>

<p>Above all, he feared the results of uniformity
and the manufacture of men by machinery,
until all youths coming out of the
same school, having studied the same facts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
in the same way, became as uniform as crackers,
and also as dry. The important man, he
thinks, is the occasional boy, who has received
a gift and can open up new realms for the
rest. "Genius? You can't manufacture a
great man, any more than you can manufacture
gold. You find gold, and mint it.
You uncover diamonds, but do not produce
them. You find genius, but you cannot
create it." Getting on, therefore, does not
mean "more horses, more footmen, more
fortune, more public honour,&mdash;it means more
personal soul. He only is advancing in life
whose heart is getting softer, whose blood
warmer, whose brain quicker, whose spirit is
entering into living peace." Education is a
preparation for complete living; therefore
Ruskin adopts Milton's definition of the complete
and generous education as, "that which
fits a man to perform justly, skillfully, and
magnanimously, all the duties of all the offices
of life."</p>

<p>Frederic Harrison gives Ruskin's <i>Unto This
Last</i> first place as the most original book in
modern English literature. He ranks it as a
masterpiece of pure, incisive, brilliant, imaginative
writing, "a book glowing with wit and
fire and passion." The heart of the message
is that every man is born with a gift appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
by his fathers, and that happiness begins with
grasping the handle of one's own being. The
greatest and most enduring work is done for
love, and not for wage. The soldier's task
is to keep the state in liberty, and when the
second or third battle of Gettysburg or Ypres
comes, he does not go on a strike, but puts
death and duty in front of him and keeps his
face to the front; in like manner the physician
is appointed to keep the state in health and
in time of yellow fever or the Black Death he
works as hard for nothing as for a large fee,
even as a father, in time of famine, shipwreck
or battle, will sacrifice himself for his son.</p>

<p>Ruskin held that the commercial text, "Buy
in the cheapest market and sell in the
dearest," was part truth, and part falsehood.
"Buy in the cheapest market? Yes; but
what made your market cheap? Charcoal
may be cheap among the roof timbers after a
fire, and bricks may be cheap in your streets
after an earthquake, but fire and earthquake
may not be, therefore, national benefits. Sell
in the dearest market? Yes; but what made
your market dear? Was it to a dying man
who gave his last coin rather than starve, or
to a soldier on his way to pillage the bank,
that you put your fortune? The final
consummation of wealth is in full-breathed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
bright-eyed and happy-hearted human creatures."
Therefore, said Ruskin, "I can
imagine that England may cast all thoughts
of possessive wealth back to the barbaric nations
among whom they first arose; and that,
while the sand of the Indias and adamant of
Golconda may yet stiffen the housings of the
charger, and flash from the turban of the
slave, she at last may be able to lead forth
her sons, saying, 'These are my jewels!'"</p>

<p>Whether, therefore, property shall be a
curse or a blessing depends upon man's administrative
intelligence. "For centuries
great districts of the world, rich in soil, and
favoured in climate, have lain desert, under
the rage of their own rivers, not only desert,
but plague-struck. The stream which,
rightly directed, would have flowed in soft
irrigation from field to field,&mdash;would have
purified the air, given food to man and beast,
and carried their burdens for them on its
bosom&mdash;now overwhelms the plain, and
poisons the wind, its breath pestilence, and its
work famine. In like manner, wealth may
become water of life, the riches of the hand
and wisdom, or wealth may be the last and
deadliest of national plagues, water of Marah,
the water of which feeds the roots of all evil."
Man's body alone is related to factory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
mine. No amount of ingenuity will ever make
iron and steel digestible. Neither the avarice
nor the rage of men will ever feed them. And
however the apple of Sodom and the grape of
Gomorrah may spread the table with dainties
of ashes and nectar of asps,&mdash;so long as men
live by bread, the far-away valleys laugh only
as they are covered with the gold of God, and
echo the shouts of His happy multitudes.</p>

<p>During the closing and most fruitful period
of his career, Ruskin's supreme thought had
to do with the manufacture of souls of good
quality. Quite beyond the influence of some
hero or statesman was the influence, hidden,
constant, but immeasurable, of the spirit of
the invisible God. "If you ask me for the
sum of my life-work, the answer is this,&mdash;whatever
Jesus saith unto you, do that."
Daniel Webster himself never made a more
powerful plea for the Christian Church and
preacher than Ruskin's statement on the
importance of the hour on Sunday, after the
people have been exposed for six days to the
full weight of the world's temptation. That
hour when men and women come in, breathless
and weary with the week's labour and "a
man sent with a message, which is a matter of
life or death, has but thirty minutes to get at
the separate hearts of a thousand men, to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
them of all their weaknesses, to shame
them for all their sins, to warn them of all
their dangers, to try by this way and that to
stir the hard fastenings of those doors, where
the Master Himself has stood and knocked, yet
none opened, and to call at the openings of
those dark streets, where Wisdom herself has
stretched forth her hands and no man hath
regarded,&mdash;thirty minutes to raise the dead in!&mdash;let
us but once understand and feel this, and
the pulpit shall become a throne like unto a
marble rock in the desert, about which the
people gather to slake their thirst."</p>

<p>And in the very fullness of his power, when
his bow was in full strength, and every sentence
and arrow tipped with fire, Ruskin
gathered his strength for a final study of the
obligations of wealth to poverty, of wisdom to
ignorance,&mdash;the opportunity of rich men to
serve their generation, and make the world
once more an Eden garden of happiness and
delight. Just as men sweep together an acre
of red roses, and condense the blossoms into
a little vial filled with the precious attar, we
may condense several volumes of Ruskin into
a single parable. Why has one man ten-talent
power? Why have ninety-nine men
only one-talent power? Why is one boy ten
years of age and strong, while in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
orphan asylum are ninety-nine little boys one
year old? And what if some kind hand hath
spread the table with orange, date, and plum,
with every sweet fruit and nutritious grain?
Has the ten-year-old boy, answering to the
ten-talent man, a right to dash up to the
table, and with one hand sweep together all
the fruits, and with the other hand, all the
cereals, milk and cream, while he shouts to the
ninety-nine little one-year-old children,
"Every fellow for himself! Get all you can!
Keep all you can! The devil take the hindmost!"
This, says Ruskin, is the fashion of
certain rust-kings, and moth-kings. Why is
that one boy ten years of age? Is his strength
not for the sole purpose of carrying these
foods to the little one-year-old children,
scarcely able to provide for themselves? It
is said of the Master and Lord of us all, that
"being rich, for our sakes He made Himself
poor." And the kings in the realm of art,
or song, of industry or finance, have been
ordained by God, not to loot the world of its
blossoms, not to squeeze men, like so many
purple clusters, into their own cups. In the
vegetable world the expert pinches off ninety-nine
roses, and forces the rich and vital currents
into one great rose at the end of the
stock. But what if a ten-talent man should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
pinch out ninety-nine lesser men as competitors,
and force the vital elements of all their
separate factories and stores, that were intended
to be distributed among many men, of
lesser gifts, into his one treasure house?</p>

<p>Ruskin not only pointed the moral but
fashioned his own life after it. He was one of
the few men who have lived what they taught.
He fell heir to what his generation thought
was a very large fortune. He made another
fortune by sheer force of genius. But he held
his treasure as a trust fund in the interest of
God's poor. And so-called practical men
turned upon him, with the bitterness and hate
of wolves that try to pull down some noble
stag. His articles were shut out of the <i>Cornhill
Magazine</i>. Through the influence of selfish
men who feared the influence of his
teachings upon the people, he was for a time
bitterly assaulted. Scoffed at and maligned,
he overworked and passed from one attack
of brain fever to another. When it was too
late, the angry voices died out of the air, and
his sun cleared itself of clouds. When at last
a wreath of honour was offered Ruskin, it was
as if an old man had taken the blossoms and
the laurel leaf, and carried them out to God's
acre, to be placed in the snow upon his
mother's grave. But ours is a world that first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
slays the prophet and then builds his sepulchre.
It is indeed, as the wise man said, a
world that crucifies the Saviour.</p>

<p>And we can say of Ruskin what James
Martineau said of the world's injustice, that
"in almost every age which has stoned the
prophets, and loaded its philosophers with
chains, the ringleaders of the anarchy have
been, not the lawless and infamous of their
day, but the archons and chief priests, who
could protect their false idols with a grand
and stiff air, and do their wrongs in the halls
of justice, and commit their murders as a
savoury sacrifice; so that it has been by no
rude violence, but by clean and holy hands
that the guides, the saints, the redeemers of
men have been poisoned in Athens, tortured
in Rome, burned in Florence, crucified in
Jerusalem." And we ought not to be surprised
that a world that threatened Milton,
starved Swammerdam, imprisoned Bunyan,
and assassinated Lincoln, should break the
health and the heart of John Ruskin, who
poured out his very life-blood to redeem the
people from ignorance, and sloth, and wrong.</p>
